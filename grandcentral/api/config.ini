	intro = "The REST API app lets you access your APIs easily. There is a main API called "item" that you can call to request data from your database :
<pre>
// Get the page_1 in json
$api = app('api');
$result = $api->call('get', ADMIN_URL.'/api.json/item/page/1');
// Post a new page and retrieve it in json
$api = app('api');
$data = array('title' => 'My new page');
$result = $api->call('post', ADMIN_URL.'/api.json/item/page', $data);
</pre>
You can also design your own APIs by creating classes called apiName where Name is the name of your Api."
