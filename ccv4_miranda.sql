This pub is interesting because it is emblamatic of a widespread phenomenon in the Anglo-Saxon world, which is the ever-increasing propensity of ''traditional "Great British" pubs'' which are at the same appealing to an isolationist trend of introspective national pride, whilst, at the same time being owned by a multinational franchise who objectively cares nothing for what it means to be "great" or "british" beyond a simple marketing strategy. Indeed, the company which manages The Hoop and Toy proudly announces as you open the door that there are more than 110 other ''traditional "Great British" pubs'' which they own and run across the island of Britain, all offering the self-same re-enchantment by re-rooting to the invented memory of what it means to be "great" and "british".

Therefore, it does not facilitate the creation of social bonds, but rather valorises the strenghtening of existing ones in an environment saturated by a certain narrative of collective memory, ''tradition'', and what it means to be "great" and "british".\r\n\r\nAmbient noise consists of moderate volume popular music, low-volume conversation and chatter.

Quinze vingt : bar à vins\r\nSitué rue Dante dans le quartier Latin, ce bar propose une façade qui ressemble à une vitrine de boutique devant laquelle se trouve un tonneau de vin. Pas de terrasse extérieure, mais le tonneau invite à poser son verre lorsque les convivives sortent fumer une cigarette. La rue, peu passante, mais rejoignant une des artères du quartier (le boulevard Saint-Germain), offre une configuration particulière qui permet aux gens qui fument en terrasse de discuter avec les passants. A l''intérieur du bar, une petite dizaine de tables en bois, un zinc derrière lequel se tiennent deux serveurs et, l''essentiel de la décoration, un mur de bouteille de vins. Ce mur présente l''ensemble des bouteilles mis à disposition pour la consommation. Les prix sont indiqués sur chacune des bouteilles. Il offre également un moment de discussion autour du choix des consommations ou, tout simplement des noms des domaines. Les deux serveurs sont avenant et parlent avec plaisir des vins qu''ils servent, de la façon dont ils sont fabriqués, etc. Un soin particulier est apporté à la vaisselle. Les verres et les carafes à décanter participent de l''histoire du lieu que nous raconte un des serveurs. Les vaisselles sont d''ailleurs en vente également. Il n''y a pas de musique. La lumière est chaleureuse. Les conversations des gens accoudés au bar ou assis aux tables du bar sont les seuls sons qui habillent l''environnement. On y serre également des planches de fromages ou de chacuterie à partager. Les personnes présentent sont de tout âge, aussi bien des femmes que des hommes, mais plutôt associés à une image assez parisienne et spécifique à ce que l''on peut attendre du public d''un bar à vin de ce quartier. La convivialité se catalyse autour des conversations et des rituels de service du vin. Chaque bouteille achetée est en effet versée dans une carafe à décanter tandis que le serveur vous raconte une histoire. On peut y rester toute une soirée ou simplement y boire l''apéritif. Les configurations de convivialités sont multiples. on y voit aussi bien des couples, deux copines qui discutent ensemble, des groupes de 5 ou 6 personnes qui ont réservé une table pour la soirée. Les toilettes du bar sont également un espace où l''on discute. Deux amis y descendent ensemble et, en attendant que les toilettes se libèrent, commentent les conversations ou les convives qui sont au-dessus. Ici, dans ce lieu intime, on voit se déployer une forme de convivialité de connivence, de couloirs, d''attente.\r\n\r\n2. On marche jusqu''au métro : \r\nLa soirée continue ensuite vers le quartier de Jaurès. L''un des convives qui doit se joindre à la soirée est appelé au téléphone pour fixer le lieu et l''heure de rdv avec le groupe. Les 6 personnes présentes prennent alors la rue Dante, la rue galande, puis la rue saint séverin pour arriver boulevard saint michel. Des micros groupes se créent durant la courte promenade. On ne boit plus ensemble, mais on s''aggrège autour de sujets de conversation ou d''affinités électives. on se raconte sa vie, lorsqu''on ne se connait pas encore ou on discute du bon vieux temps lorsqu''on ne s''est pas vu depuis longtemps. On offre une cigarette à son voisin ou sa voisine pour passer d''un micro groupe à un autre. Le groupe de départ se difracte et se contracte gardant une espèce d''unité floue qui concrêtise l''objectif géographique où l''on se dirige et la convivialité spécifique aux déambulations dans les rues de Paris. \r\n\r\n3. Metro Pérégrination : arrivé au métro, le groupe s''engouffre dans la station saint michel. Le train arrive sur le quai, les portes s''ouvrent, les différents membres du groupe montent dans le même wagon. Les petits groupes se rassemblent autour de la barre à laquelle on se tient et le groupe retrouve sa forme originelle, celle qu''il avait au bar à vin. Ici la barre centrale fait office de point de rassemblement, tout comme l''était la caraffe à vin précédemment, ou comme le serai une sorte de totem tribal. Chacun se tient à la barre, les mains se touchent éventuellement et les discussions flottent au grès des bousculades à la montée ou à la descente de nouveaux voyageurs. \r\n\r\n4. Jaurès : diner en terrasse\r\nLe Jaurès se trouve quai de Loire, sur le canal de l''Ourcq, qui va jusqu''au bassin de la villette. Le quartier est animé par les deux MK2 qui se font face sur le canal et par les différents bars qui ont ouverts sur les bords du canal à la suite de l''ouverture d''une cité universitaire. Le Jaurès correspond au café brasserie parisien typique. Il y a une terrasse chauffée assez grandes (environ 100 places) dans laquelle se retrouve les fumeurs. En arrivant au bar, les places ne sont pas libre. Le groupe stationne alors devant le bar, fumant une cigarette ou discutant de ce qu''il y a à boire et à manger dans cette brasserie. on passe ici à un autre registre de convivialité qui n''est pas celui de l''apéritif ou du déplacement urbain, mais bien celui du diner entre amis. La nourriture, dans un premier temps est au centre des conversations. Qu''est-ce que tu me conseilles, demande l''un des membres à un autre. L''habitué catalyse le groupe autour de la question du diner. Les serveurs invitent alors les convives à s''installer autour d''une grande table qui est faite d''un banc en bois entouré de tabourets. Chacun s''asseois au hasard. Le garçon amène alors les cartes et les couverts qu''il jette sur la table invitant les convives à se les répartir. Le partage des couverts marque, en quelque sorte, la transformation du banc et du bar en table à manger et en restaurant, mais produit aussi une forme de décontraction vis à vis des formalisations liés aux repas. Deux des membres du groupe commande des pintes de bierre blonde (Afligem) les autres commandent une bouteille de vin rouge (Syrah). On retrouve alors les discussions qui prolongent l''expérience du bar à vin, chacun y allant de son commentaire sur les vins proposés à la carte du jaurès, l''expert concluant par l''idée d''un monocépage. Chacun passe ensuite commande, les plats arrivent, on mange, on s''échange les goûts et les saveurs en faisant gouter à son voisin ou sa voisine. La nourriture est alors le centre des discussions et des émotions partagées. très bon ce tartare ou c''est quoi que tu as pris déjà? autant de relances qui ponctuent la convivialité liée à la nourriture. Une fois les assiettes terminées, on recommande à boire, toujours bierre d''un côté et vin de l''autre. Les discussions reprennent et l''alcool et la fatigue aidant, les discussions se mélanges, deviennent moins clairs et plus franches. Les blagues sont graveleuses, les conversations parfois aussi, on refait un peu de philosophie, on commente sa journée avec un oeil plus lucide que quelques heures auparavant, bref le groupe se construit autour d''une forme de déconstruction narrative. Un évènement vient troublé la fête lorsque l''un des convives se fait voler son sac. On tente de pourchasser les voleurs. Sans succès. Un nouvel évènement vient alors au centre de la conversation, on fait preuve d''empathie, d''inquiétude auprès de l''ami victime du vol.Puis celui pour qui le groupe s''était déplacé arrive enfin. Il ne connaît pas tout le monde, on fait alors les présentations. On recommande à boire et la soirée reprend son cours. L''heure avance et l''épée de damoclès du dernier métro se fait de plus en plus pressante. Une dernière tournée est proposée, mais le bar ferme ses portes. Le groupe sort, puis se sépare. La majorité des convives rentrent chez eux, deux poursuivront la fête jusqu''à tard dans la nuit. \r\n', 38, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/25204ef4a5ec9f66.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/9504c67605678271.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/eecdb8cc0087ac30.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/39b0076e28228e85.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/863722ba50d48216.jpg"}]', 1),

Thereafter, the decoration, the theme and everything that goes along with it. Here, objects are posed in order to re-create ways of creating and re-creating an atmosphere which gives the public an impression of being part of a stage, a scene, almost scripted.

Kensington is one of the more expensive residential districts in central London, and Evans & Peel detective agency is operating in that environment, catering to a clientele of between 25 and 45, a significantly wide age bracket, according to Vincent. Vincent himself lives in Earl’s Court, not far from where he works, because - as he says - “I’m too busy to do anything much else but work because of the demand we get in this place”. Vincent is 34 years old, and has worked in bars, restaurants and night clubs since he was 18. In addition to this, he holds a BA in hospitality and catering, and an MA in events management. Vincent had worked with the owner of Evans & Peels on previous ventures before coming to work there, first as bar manager, and subsequently as general manager as the owner himself moved on to find further areas for investment and development. As Vincent himself says “I’ve always loved working in bars, there’s a great buzz about the place, always meeting new people and that... Evans & Peel is all the better, ‘cause it’s co interesting and people get such a kick out of it”.\r\n\r\nResponding to the question about his last concrete experience of conviviality/sociality, Vincent gleefully replied “that’s my job”. According to Vincent, his position as general manager at Evans & Peel detective agency, because of the unique storytelling an participative element of the job, allows him to have a greater contact with the customers than would normally be possible. The fact that the theme of the bar - that of a prohibition era speakeasy - requires customers to book in advance means that they are from the very beginning more committed to the experience of sociality.  Also, the participative storytelling aspect of the experience not only adds ludic value, but further augments this feeling of commitment and participation on the part of the customers. So in short, for Vincent, this renders the everyday act of working more convivial, with his guests as with his colleagues, since he is involved in the very act of creating this atmosphere of conviviality through a combination of storytelling and initiation. \r\n\r\nFor Vincent, this kind of themed bar with a heavy aspect of participation is not the norm, against the backdrop of traditional english pubs and nightclubs. However, it is emerging as a major tendency against the backdrop of a certain saturation and disenchantment with the traditional, the norm, the ordinary experience of the English pub with ale, bitter, and cider. As Vincent said “what people want these days is something out of the ordinary, something to distract them from the hum-drum, and to make them feel they’re part of something”. It is this very participative aspect, according to Vincent, which means that in the context of a highly competitive market, Evans & Peel detective agency can serve expensive drinks to a non-stop stream of customers, many of whom are regulars, and who many not be that wealthy, but who are willing to sacrifice a significant portion of their disposable income in order to participate in this feeling of implication, of ‘being together’, and of intrigue. Vincent cited several other themed cocktail bars in London, and even one other prohibition/speakeasy themed cocktail bar, citing peoples’ love of all that it ‘retro’ and ‘vintage’ as the main reason behind this.\r\n\r\nFor Vincent the main catalyst of conviviality at Evans & Peel is “all about playing the game. People love it, they feel like they’re part of a secret club, a group, some kind of inner circle once they get past the bookcase”. The complex rendering of a narrative is what enables Vincent and his colleagues to create an atmosphere of conviviality and sociality, and an atmosphere that facilitates new encounters and a deepening of existing social bonds through mutual playing and storytelling. Many people even dress up, often in elaborate an period clothing, only to come to Evans and Peel to engage in the experience of being deeper as a part of that story. The importance of this playful storytelling is something, according to Vincent, which flows onward and outward from the venue of Evans and Peel and affects people in their everyday lives - and they like it. This aspect of storytelling is at the same time complex, compelling, and seamlessly executed according to vincent - “Once you’re through the doors, you’re part of the game”.\r\n\r\nVincent has noticed significant changes in the way people socialise in recent years. Amongst the most significant of the changes is the observation of a turning away from traditional pubs and clubs that were offering nothing more than a place to be and to drink. Of course, as he said “those places will always stick around”, but where it’s really “hot” right now is in venues that augment the experience of sociality by an extra dimension of involvement, a way in which the venue can reach out to its customers. This can be by involving them in a narrative (storytelling), by offering advantages or services, but also by bringing the venue of conviviality into hitherto unexpected places. In particular, here, Vincent mentioned bars and cafes in museums, libraries, cinemas, hotels, and specialist shops as being important venues where there is a growth in the interaction between the simple acts of eating and and drinking and other acts of consumption in general, which augment both at the same time as giving the participants the impression of being “part of a club” - the same essential factor at work with Evans & Peel.\r\n\r\nFor Vincent the significant changes in the ways in which people celebrate and socialise together are reflected in these changes in ‘lieux de convivialité’. This means that whether it is at home or outside, there is a greater involvement of storytelling, and implication in part of a ‘club’ of shared interest, whether it is a food, sports, music, or other interest group. \r\n\r\nVincent says that “in particular for Evan’s and Peel, the technological part is important - to a point. Over 70% of our bookings happen online, and we also use the facebook page to organise events like our burlesque sundays… people even use it to meet up and make connections after they have met in person”. For Vincent, however, this digital aspect is most important in so far as it augments the lived experience of being in the venue itself. That is, as an organisational tool, as a marketing tool, and as a tool for maintaining the adherence once it has been created in the minds of the public. The use of photo-sharing platforms is also important, but mainly from the customer side, in that they will often post, tag, and share their photos of evan’s and peel in particular, to demonstrate with a certain amount of pride the fact that they have been there to each other and to their groups of friends.\r\n\r\nFor Vincent, this phenomenon of change has gone hand-in-hand with a gradual disenchantment with the forms of conviviality based on a standard english pub experience. In his opinion, this is a form of conviviality which no longer attracts peoples attention, or holds it, since they are stuffy, cold and outdated environments that are of no major importance today. \r\n\r\nVincent sees these trends continuing over the next five to ten years, that if anything, the storytelling aspect of conviviality will become more and more important. Also important for Vincent is the aspect of exclusivity. In his view, this is created at Evans and Peel through the combination of high demand and medium capacity. The very fact of there being only finite demand means that people want it all the more for that. As he says “It’s not like every other chain pub, it’s not just another JDs or Weatherspoon’s”.  In the absence of formal class distinctions, he says, british people still crave a way to differentiate, to tell stories and be together, but apart at the same time.\r\n\r\n', 52, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/7c00d5bb5df1bcf1.jpg","title":"Vincent"}]', 1),

Paul is a public intellectual, who frequently makes public appearances, on television, radio, and in debates. His works, which have been of great impact have been translated into Italian, French, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. His greatest publication success was with the work ‘The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness’, and he continues to enjoy scholarly success with it. He has also worked on multiculturalism in London and the UK generally, and on multicultural conviviality in particular. Responding to the question of what got him interest in that aspect of conviviality, he answered that “Well, having done my PhD on black rights and cultural issues, I later became interested in the dynamics of multicultural interaction and the forms of conviviality that it produces. London in that sense is particularly important and interesting, since there are very few cities like it in the world - certainly it is the only one of its kind in Europe. Here, there is so much cultural, ethnic, even linguistic diversity. It is on every street, almost every neighbourhood”.\r\n\r\nResponding to the question about his last concrete experience of conviviality/sociality, Paul replied that it was probably “after a conference on multiculturalism”. Reflecting on this question, Paul added that the fact that brought them together and bonded them was almost certainly the same one, a shared interest in a theme and field of research. For Paul it was this proven aspect of initiation that legitimated the various participants of the group to contribute to the creation of a sociality and conviviality. Even despite the fact that many of them did not personally know one another before the event itself, they were connected by their professional, intellectual and cultural interests, and a shared passion for their field of research and their shared intellectual values. Immediately, he said, they had a shared history, a lexicon, a bank of data to work from. This is not a given with all of his day-to-day colleagues, but more particularly with those specifically within his field.\r\n\r\nFor Paul, this kind of experience of conviviality and sociality is not the norm, but as he said “the structure is probably quite normal, you know, people who come together for one or other combination of reasons, passions, shared interests… It’s evidentially going to create a fertile bond for the creation of social bonds somewhere along the line”. In terms of the UK academic scene, the respondent claims that this kind of conviviality, which he described as “passionate yet calm, discussion-centered” is representative, also owing to the character of the participants.\r\n\r\nFor Paul the main catalyst of conviviality at this conference reception was almost certainly the “shared passions, backgrounds, formation, culture and character” of the guests. The participants qualify themselves, legitimate their participation, largely through having taken part in a common journey to get there, “even if that have all walked different paths: speakers, listeners, organisers, guests”. This aspect of commitment is without doubt the catalyst of the conviviality, giving participants the impression that it is the rare venue that they can talk unabashedly about their true intellectual passions and research interests, past, present, and future. It is through the “shared intellectual ground”, this catalyst, that the relation between participants can make the journey from being professional to being personal, affective and therefore passionate. He remarked wryly that “more than once” he saw such an evening becoming the beginning of a romantic encounter. He coyly declined to comment as to whether this had ever been the case for him. Nevertheless, he said, this kind of social encounter is of great importance, not only for personal or affective reasons, but also in the creation of professional and intellectual bonds, the forging of partnerships and recruitment. \r\n\r\nPaul has noticed “changes of deep and irreversible significance” in the way people socialise in recent years. Amongst the most significant of the changes is the observation of a turning away from traditional pubs, which are for him, “deeply identified with a specific meaning of what it means to be british, favouring one narrative against the wealth and complexity of contemporary Londonian culture”. He believes that such venues are unlikely to disappear, but that increasingly in London are they giving way to a venue that “better represents the multicultural complexity of contemporary London”. This, for him, explains the rise of international cuisine, bars with ethnic and non-national themes and styles. For Paul, the decline of the traditional pub, much bemoaned in the press, is something that demonstrates the inability of this model to adapt to the new environment, but that there are “several notable exceptions, usually the few independent pubs that remain in central London, but which are more common in the periphery, which is anyway the real melting point, the real site of social change”. For Paul, the important factor of success of the ‘ethnic’ model is that it creates a strong narrative (storytelling), something that people can take part in (rooting), and connection to a community. According to Paul, even for ‘white’ british, this is the case, as the traditional pub image no longer represents them.\r\n\r\nFor Paul the significant changes in the ways in which people celebrate and socialise together are reflected in these changes in ‘lieux de convivialité’. This means that whether it is at home or outside, there is a greater involvement of storytelling, community, narrative, the feeling of being part of of a ‘club’ of shared interests, an etnie.., whether it is a food, sports, music, or other interest group. There is also, according to him, a great rise in interest in forms of conviviality and venues which innovate in their theme, the way they make a narrative experience out of the visit. He told me of one example, where and old cinema was renovated, and where viewings are organised, in which all guests are instructed to come dressed as a certain type of character. before viewing of the film, which they didn’t know the name of before hand, there is a role playing scenario, involving character immersion, re-enactment, along with eating and drinking, which enhances the experience of the film and visa-versa.\r\n\r\nPaul says that he has noticed a significant growth in the use of technology around the creation of sociality and conviviality, but that most of this “doesn’t really apply” to him. He perceives that facebook, twitter, and social networking in general are “clearly indispensable for organisation”, but that websites of recommendations, fora, discussion groups are “more and more important”. The sharing of digital images and impressions has also taken on a role of importance, but here again Paul seemed to suggest that it applied less to him, since it wasn’t his practice. \r\n\r\nFor Paul, this phenomenon of change seems to have gone hand-in-hand with a gradual disenchantment with the forms of conviviality based on a standard english pub experience. In his opinion, this is a form of conviviality - “with a few notable exceptions” - which no longer attracts peoples attention, or holds it, since they are stuffy, cold and outdated environments that are of no major importance today, in light of the changing ethnic and cultural composition of the city.\r\n\r\nPaul sees these trends continuing over the next five to ten years, that if anything, the community and storytelling aspects of conviviality will become more and more important. For Paul, the idea of being rooted in a community, of sharing a connection that is at once open and distinct (exclusive), will remain important for the next generation of britons. As the composition of the population becomes more diverse, said Paul, so too will the manifold forms of conviviality and sociality that exist in “what is already one of the world’s most heterogeneous social environments”.\r\n\r\n', 53, 'null', 'null', 1),

Molly is an intellectual, who frequently makes public appearances in debates and in academic conferences. Her works, which have been of great impact in the field of narrative research have been translated into German, Japanese, and Spanish. His greatest publication success was with the work ‘Doing Narrative Research’ (2008), and she continues to enjoy scholarly success with it. He has also worked on narratives of family and everyday life in London and the UK generally. Responding to the question of what was her main interest in that field of conviviality as study, she answered that “From the perspective of my research, Conviviality is something that starts in the home. Regardless of the ‘type’ or ‘shape’ of the family, it is in the familial setting that we first learn to socialise, and understand our place in the lives and worlds of others, however perfectly or imperfectly”.\r\n\r\nResponding to the question about his last concrete experience of conviviality/sociality, Molly replied that it was “an evening at home with my husband and some old friends of ours”. Expanding on this question, Molly noted that the fact that brought them together and bonded them was as much everything that had gone behind them, the years of sedimentation and shared understandings and meaning that meant that they could be at ease with one another, that they could understand and respect each other, regardless of where they were at that given moment in time, what they were doing, their personal situation, etc. This means a conception of family that includes non-blood relatives, of different ages and backgrounds who had entered each others lives through time.  \r\n\r\nFor Molly, this kind of experience of conviviality and sociality is “totally the norm, to one extent or another”. That is to say that the structure is quite normal, that even though what it means to “be” a family might change, the structure or a group of people sharing strong bonds and creating homes together is unlikely to do so. And that it is this structure which forms one of the essential social building blocks (Maff’s ‘moral prison’).\r\n\r\nFor Molly the main catalyst of conviviality at this gathering in the home was certainly the “years of shared history, the understandings, the emotional currency we all hold in ample stock” of the guests. The participants qualify themselves, legitimate their participation, largely through having taken part in a common journey to get there, “over years of knowing each other, and being part of each others lives, sharing joys, problems, burdens, and hopes”. For Molly, this aspect of prior knowledge and experienc is without doubt the catalyst of the conviviality, giving the participants the impression that they were immediately in a setting of conviviality from the moment they come together as a group. It is only as a group, in this form, that they can share stories, insights, and joys that even in pairs they might shy away from - it is “the place where everything comes out, where it’s all on the table”. For her, groups like these have the effect of holding each other together, even, for example, keeping married couples together through difficult times.\r\n\r\nMolls has noticed “pretty important changes” in the way people socialise in recent years. Amongst the most significant of the changes is the observation of a renovation of the traditional pub, which are for her, “quite representative of something deeply rooted in the whole idea of ‘britishness’, but in need of being brought up to date, especially in a place like London”. She believes that such venues are highly unlikely to disappear, since they are “such an important cultural staple” but that increasingly in London are they giving way to a gathering of venues that “reflects the diversity of the place”. For Molly, these changes are simply reflective of broader forms of social change, whereby the facts and ways of being together will change accordingly. The growing diversity, heterogeneity, the multiplicity of ways of being and breakdown of traditional structures necessarily mean that new forms will emerge. If the traditional pub as the english ‘lieu de convivialité par excellence’ will maintain its place of prominence will only be shown after “the test of time”. For Molly, one of the key factors of success to this model will ultimately be their ability to bring people into “an attractive and embracing narrative, which gives meaning to their everyday lives” (storytelling). This, in an city like London, with a high number of changing variables at the same time, remains a complex question, and it is not at all clear for Molly that on single model will emerge dominant as the pub has been.\r\n\r\nFor Molly the significant changes in the ways in which people celebrate and socialise together are reflected in these changes in ‘lieux de convivialité’, and the growth of new models. This means that whether it is at home or outside, there is a greater involvement of storytelling, adventure, community, narrative, the feeling of being part of of a ‘club’ of shared interests, a family... whether it is a food, sports, music, or another interest group - such as a biological family. According to Molly, new forms of conviviality are being found in unexpected places, often where alcohol is absent, or at least where it is not the main focus of the event. For example, there is a growing phenomenon of well being as a group activity, particularly for women. This can be seen, particularly in the proliferation of nail bars, beauty salons, etc etc… “even those places where you go so that fish can eat your feet”. One of the most interesting in London, according to Molly, is that of a spa where they project cinema and TV series popular with women whilst they enjoy hot tubs and champagne. In these cases, the aspect of body sharing and intimacy - its creation and reinforcement - is evidentially important.\r\n\r\nMolly says that he has noticed a certain growth in the use of technology around the creation of sociality and conviviality, but that of this “doesn’t really apply to me, or most of my friends - we’re too old”. She perceives that facebook, twitter, and social networking in general are “obviously very important to younger people”, but that she herself doesn’t use them at all. Websites for recommendations, fora, discussion groups are “more important” to her, but usually for find specific information about something someone else has told her about. She has noticed that the sharing of digital images and impressions has also taken on a role of importance, but here again Molly said that it wasn’t the case for her since she doesn’t “even have a smartphone”.\r\n\r\nFor Molly, these phenomena of change seems to have gone hand-in-hand with a gradual disenchantment with the forms of conviviality based on a standard English pub experience. In his opinion, this is a form of conviviality is “less relevant to the inner and the externalized narratives of everyday life as they are practiced”.  This will, for Molly, continue to be part of the picture in the future, but as narratives become increasingly heterogeneous and diverse, they are “bound to change, one way or another”. For Molly, this change is generally positive, and reflects the diversity which is “the real strength of London”.\r\n\r\nMolly sees these trends continuing over the next five to ten years, that if anything, the community, adventure, and storytelling aspects of conviviality will become more and more important. For Molly, the idea of being part of a group, of sharing a connection with a discreet group of people, will become increasingly important in London society. As this society becomes more complex and diverse, so too - she believes - will become the forms of conviviality practiced there.\r\n', 54, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/aa2841cf69d6ae75.jpg","title":"Molly Andrews"}]', 1),

The restaurant which is small and usually busy is underneath, with a large area open to the street in fine weather. The colour scheme throughout is black gloss coupled with muted yellow - a classic combination. The whole building has an air of genteel dilapidation, harking back to an earlier, more civilised age, as stylish and comfortable as a bespoke pair of brown brogues that has been handed down to the younger son of an aristocratic family whose fortune has dwindled but whose pride is still strong. \r\n\r\nThe main heart of the place is the club rather than the restaurant, that was why it was founded. Soho, traditionally the sex-capital of London, has in recent years become the heart of the creative industries -- advertising, film-making, publishing -- and still more recently, it is also in the midst of London''s restaurant revival.\r\n\r\nThe Academy''s raison d''etre is to provide a private, friendly and exclusive space for writers, publishers and intellectuals to gather and hang out. Somewhat in the mold of the grand gentlemen''s clubs in Pall Mall, in terms of its exclusivity and privacy, it differentiates itself via a certain polite informality and, importantly, low cost for membership. It provides good quality food in the modern British-European style, and has an extensive wine list, which is the staple drink (red) of the clientele. There are old prints of London on the wall, the tables and floorboards are rickety, and while the smoking ban is observed, the walls remain stained by the spoors of long since smoked cigarettes. The membership are almost all middle-aged or older, tweedy intellectual gentlemen and their wives and girlfriends: the feisty intellectuals, writers and journalists whose names would have been familiar to the culturally aware twenty years ago, but whose fame has dwindled now. They dress smartly out of habit rather than out of a sense of occasion. The lighting is low and intimate.

This is not just a problem for The Academy, she sees it in restaurants around London. Partly she views it as a symptom of a more health conscious society; partly it is the collapse of the economy and a tightening of purse strings on company expense accounts, and the loss of tax-benefits; but mainly it is the fear that being away from one''s desk for too long during the day will result in a black mark against your name, that finishing a bottle of wine at lunch means you don''t take your work seriously. People are too afraid to drink at lunchtime. \r\n\r\nAnd as for the digital? Mobile phones are banned in the Academy - the idea is to encourage people to talk, or to allow others to talk face to face. They don''t have a website, they are not on twitter. Membership is by election only and word of mouth recommendations. Most members know who each other is, and recognise them at least by sight. \r\n\r\nIn the future Mandana is worried that the membership will dwindle with age, but it would be antithetical to the ethos of the place to try to attract new members any other way, and to change the profile of the Academy.', 62, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/video\\/056ad4106b74a82c.mov"},{"url":"\\/image\\/96d4d468cc2a94c7.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/7ab555af13259c27.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/3d1db43664469b72.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/f1f9978fca719cdf.JPG"}]', 1),

Situated just North of its centre, it is home to London zoo. It comprises an area of approximately 1 square kilometre of cultivated parkland, including lawns, roses gardens, aboretums, sports pitches, cafes, ice-cream stands, lakes, and a handful of buildings such as Regents park college - an independent further education establishment. \r\n\r\nIn nice weather such as today and on a bank holiday (which is like the weekend), the main crowd is quite predictable: young families having picnics. I would estimate that this is made up 50% of tourists and outsiders (i.e. by outsiders, I mean British people who do not live in London), and 50% Londoners themselves. \r\n\r\nThe spread themselves throughout the entirety of the park in little groups, usually of about 5 - 10 people, each establishing their own spot on which to spread out bags, rugs, coats, and so on. Many of the families will bring entertainment in the form of basic sports equipment. A bat and ball, a football, a frisbee. A large number bring books and newspapers. \r\n\r\nThere is very little boundary in terms of social class, although within this broad scope of class, it is in general the more aspirational members who come; that is to say, going to the park is seen as a "good" and beneficial (healthy, educational, not wasting a world-class amenity) activity, as well as one which requires a little effort: packing, getting there, putting up with the wind and the possibility of changing weather. \r\n\r\nHaving made the effort to arrive, the families (though another large group are friends in the 20s - early 30s, there are few middle-aged groups, singletons and couples and there are few old-people in the park who come to picnic, though more may visit the zoo or wander around the rose-garden) will stay for a minumum of several hours. \r\n\r\nThey will bring a picnic consisting of bread, cheese, cured meats, crisps, soft drinks (rarely much alcohol- perhaps a bottle of wine or a couple of cold beers, but this is the minority; the groups of people in their 20s will usually bring a few cold beers), salads, spreads, (eg humus), and perhaps some fresh fruit for desert. This is seens as something of a luxury, though not a great luxury.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is considered an effortful though minor treat. They might later on buy an ice-cream which will be considered a great treat. Most do not go into the cafe or restaurant as this is expensive; those that do are tourists. Nonetheless the cafe/restaurant is extremely full as even a small proportion of the people in the park counts as several hundred. \r\n\r\nThe parents of the families sit and read or gossip in the sunlight, while the kids run around, playing with the ball or chasing each other. \r\n\r\nThere is a relaxed and highly convivial mood, but there is rarely any mingling between groups. Sometimes, two families who are friends or neighbours will travel to the park together to allow the parents and the children of each to catch up. It is an activity of togetherness rather than outward sharing. \r\n\r\nThere is a ritual aspect to enjoying the sunshine "while it is there", and a sense of not wasting a lovely opportunity. As such, a family will not go for a picnic in the park very many times in the year, on average perhaps 4 or 5 times over the whole summer.  The young adults will come more frequently, it being a less formal exercise - since they do not usually bring a full picnic - normally just crisps and beer. They consider the park a nice area to meet up and chill out with friends. \r\n\r\nUse of technology is not evident except with singletons and young adults in groups. The singletons will listen to music and sleep - as will some in the groups of young adults, and read their emails, facebook and text message. They will take photos of the day and put them on facebook, instagram etc. The families are more likely to use phones only for photographs perphaps to be put in an album, or uploaded into some digital form at a later date. Having arrived at about 11 or noon, they will leave in the mid to late afternoon as the weather cools and they get tired.

Interestingly, the trend towards an emphasis on organic has waned in recent years, even though it was the organic movement that was at the vanguard of the change - customers are now prepared to listen to farmers who tell them that a small amount of judiciously used pesticide on a well managed farm can be just as healthy - and is certainly cheaper than - organic produce.

Many artisan cooks with specific dishes sell at these places. Prices are not low: a customer will happily pay £4 for a sausage in a bun. \r\n\r\nThere is a very diverse range of goods available - mostly food, but also flowers, jewellery, sometimes clothing.

IN addition, they noticed that those festivals which did best had diversified from a focus on their particular cultural offering, to a wider celebration of everything that is somehow (or at least apparently) not mass market: thus festivals now occur chiefly, in the countryside, and involve copious amounts of local food and drink. \r\n\r\nThese developments are entirely in line with the food-cultural shift towards fresh, local produce; the festival culture has recognised that food and drink are essential to all celebrations, and embraced the latest trend in food and drink culture. \r\n\r\nThey are of course, also occasions where bands play, this will usually be something closer to world or folk music than pop or rock, although both pop and rock are not unknown; jazz is not uncommon on these occasions. There will be comedians, activities - particularly folk activities such as archery or hay-bale tossing.

Often there were teenage couples on a sort of date. The variety of shops is large, but there is a preponderance of fashion outlets.

They are very costly for what they are and generally low quality; although going to the cinema is obviously not a particularly expensive activity, it is considered a treat, so spending money on overpriced but tasty food feeds into the sense of treating oneself. Similarly, the restaurants near the cinema are very similar. Nandos, Pizza Express, Byron Burgers. These are chains doing reasonably good food at reasonable prices. A treat, but not excessively so, and comforting, familiar.\r\n\r\nThe cinema is a space that crosses social boundaries, although it is fair to say that more working and lower-middle class families and teens (the main demographic here) are likely to attend this kind of cinema, with professional middle and upper middle classes more likely to go to the independent cinemas.\r\n\r\nThe films on offer in this type of cinema are the big hollywood blockbusters and high-profile European offerings. \r\n\r\nThe decor is designed to re--inforce this sense of comfort everywhere. It is deep in colour, all very soft. Technology is also present in the form of screens showing which films are on, and things like 3D glasses, and although using phones is considered a bit of a faux pas in cinemas, it is one people habitually indulge in, often, for example, checking facebook midway through the film.\r\n\r\nPeople interact quite relaxedly and suprisingly animatedly at the cinema. It is definitely an exciting thing to watch a film "out" when one could easily stay at home and watch something. So families with young children enter the building amid a hubub of chatter. There is also a good number of teenage couples on dates, no doubt seeking to take advantage of the darkness of surroundings...

You can explore almost every part of the city and there is even a tour showing you the crime scenes of the German TV series “Tatort”: http://www.berlinbiketour.eu/tatort-berlin-fahrradtour-58.de/articles/tatort-berlin-fahrradtour.html \r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the group gathers at one spot and receives instructions by one of the two guides, which takes about 15 to 20 minutes before starting the tour. Watching the beginning of a tour of 12 or 13 year old schoolchildren, I was a little surprised about the collective giggling and enthusiasm. After all, riding a bike is not the most thrilling thing in the world. However, doing it in a group of people while exploring the city, which is practically unknown to most tourists, appears to make it something special. Observing quite a number of these episodes, I can say that the collective excitement at the beginning is visible for people of all ages, the very young and the older groups being the most enthusiastic. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I could spot quite a number of people who didn’t appear to be comfortable being part of such a big group, riding bikes with big yellow signs shouting out: “Berlin on Bike”.  Particularly some older teenagers and young adults didn’t seem to enjoy the tour that much. They probably didn’t want to be recognized as tourists immediately and would prefer to explore the city on their own.     \r\n\r\nI couldn''t find anyone having alcoholic beverage during the bike tour. Being a sporty event and taking place around midday, this is not a big surprise. Also, there is a big discussion about the problem of drunk-cycling in Germany at the moment.

The only areas where cricket is unlikely to be practised are at the very centres of large urban areas. So in London there are extremely strong teams and vibrant leagues based in the near suburbs and outwards, and certainly in the countryside, where the village teams are very popular. Another feature of cricket in the country is the way certain immigrant communities (drawn from the old colonies of the empire) maintain teams, usually of a very high standard, based around their ethnicity in culture. Thus around London many of the best club sides are made up exclusively of immigrants from Pakistan and India. \r\n\r\nIn spite of the continued fan-base and healthy number of people playing the game, that is something that is on the decline, and well run clubs have been forced to organise more fun and informal events, rather than just the normal fixture list of matches, to maintain funds and membership.

What is this place? Is it a bar, club, restaurant, co-working space or gallery? The answer: It is all of that and a lot more. \r\n\r\nSome friends and I went to one of their events called “Lost in Food”, a three-course vegetarian menu served once a week. Fortunately we reserved a table since the place was already quite busy when we arrived at around 7 pm. After entering “Stattbad”, we approached a bar with a large video installation. It showed some chickens happily trotting around at a farm. The whole place still looked very much like a natatorium. They just used lights in different colors, some art pieces as well as modern and retro furniture as decoration. At first, we needed to pay 7 euros in advance in order to get three tickets for the menu (appetizer, main dish, dessert). We were told to just raise a ticket whenever we are ready for the next course. \r\n\r\nLeaving the bar and moving on to the “dining area”, I was surprised by the cheap folding chairs awaiting us.

Most of them were drinking wine or beer from the local brewery called “Lammsbräu” or the typical popular Bavarian beer “Augustiner”. Non-alcoholic beverages (coke, different lemonades, etc.), filled up in 0.3 bottles with nicely designed labels, were provides by a local company as well. The food was not exceptionally good, but every course was somehow an unconventional mix. \r\n\r\nIt took quite a long time until every group got their food and had finished the three courses. At the beginning the building seemed to create a sterile atmosphere but soon people were chatting, drinking, enjoying themselves and starting to feel more and more comfortable in the strange environment. When it was dark outside the music was turned on and you immediately felt more like being in a club than having dinner.

Firstly he worked for many years (until recently, and is still involved non-professionally)as a naval officer in charge of running University Royal Naval units - in other words, Naval training for undergraduate students who are interested in joining the navy. \r\n\r\nThe other aspect of Paul''s expertise is in Freemasonry, and he is a senior member. \r\n\r\nThe University Royal Naval Unit, although to some extent a training activity, is certainly a social one too. It draws together people at a given University who have some interest in military activity and wish to try it out, but does not require any kind of genuine active military service. In other words it is a kind of club. \r\n\r\nMr. Engeham is clear that those who join it come from all sorts of social backgrounds, the only real common factor being an interest in physical activity (not sport as such), and military training. As such it is tilted towards males, but by no means exclusively so. \r\n\r\nThe nature of the club, according to Engeham, and the secret of its success and popularity (he says it is a very popular activity, with more applicants than places available, and has been for some time), is that it provides a sense of community and structure within university life which would otherwise be lacking, particularly in Universities which do not have a college structure. \r\n\r\nThe activities are physical, and demanding, there is - of course - a strong element of military role play. There is a lot of banter, and certainly the socialising involves a lot of drinking (beer and whisky are two top contenders in popularity), but there is also a strong sense of community, team work and group bonding, bringing together people in a university who would not otherwise have met or bonded.\r\n\r\nAs for the Freemasonry, Paul is clear that while it is an activity that is predominantly the preserve of older white males (in this country, although it is thriving in places like India, for example), and although the membership is to some extent in decline, what is happening is that the large level of older membership is dying out and being replaced by younger members - albeit at a slightly slower rate. There are two main elements to Freemasonry which he believes are its attraction: 1) Ritual and provision of moral purpose in a society where traditional structures providing those things have broken down\r\n2) Community and socialising\r\n\r\nHe says that new membership is largely drawn from ambitious, middle class young men, but that it is in no way a place for people to look for social preferment; if it is suspected that that is the motive for somebody seeking to join the Freemasons, they are excluded from becoming members. \r\n\r\nFood and drink is a strong part of Freemasonry - with most "lodge" meetings (a lodge is regional centre for the masons) ending in a dinner. These can range from smart slap up affairs with lots of wine, to tea and saandwiches. The emphasis is on solidarity, brotherhood and community.

Un groupe arrivé à la fin du concert tente de négocier une réduction du prix d''entrée.\r\n\r\nA l''intérieur tout le monde danse, à l''exception de rares personnes attablées buvant de la bière ou des coktails. Le volume sonore est assez élevé, il faut être très près d''une personne pour lui dire quelque chose, ou sortir pour pouvoir discuter. Il y a très peu de lumière et celle-ci est rouge. On peut voir un écran dans un coin de la salle, sur lequel des vidéos sont montrées, sans le son. L''endroit est fumeur, l''air confiné, il fait très chaud. Les personnes présentes sont des adultes de tout âge, pour la plupart en tenue décontractée. Certains enlèvent leurs chaussures pour danser plus confortablement.\r\n \r\nLes gens dansent et la musique y invite, le groupe sur scène est composé d''un saxophoniste, d''un guitariste, d''un percussioniste, et une chanteuse. A la fin du concert, le public réclame un bis, en allemand ou en turc, s''ensuit une dernière chanson, une reprise particulièrement réussie d''une chanson d''amour populaire turque au texte très kitsch,"ah bu hayat cekilmez" (cette vie est insupportable si tu n''es pas là mon âme, etc.), chanson connue d''à peu près tout le monde dans le public. Tout le monde chante ce refrain (d''autant plus populaire qu''il a été repris dans un clip publicitaire de la plus importante compagnie de téléphone turque).\r\nAprès le concert, un DJ s''occupe de la musique, remixe des morceaux traditionnels turcs, perses et arabes. A l''occasion de certains morceaux, les gens cessent de danser individuellement et dansent le halay (terme qui ne désigne pas une danse en particulier mais diverses danses traditionnelles, généralement pratiquées lors des mariages et fêtes en Anatolie mais aussi dans le Caucase et les Balkans). Les gens forment alors un cercle en se tenant par l''auriculaire et progressent sur le côté, de droite à gauche, en répétant une série de pas de manière synchrone.

Puis à NYC sur une problématique différente cher MKI (Malibu Kaluha). Les US représentant 70% des apports de Malibu et Kaluha, dans un climat de "cohabitation" avec les acteurs d''une boite qui étaient soudés et américains et "quelques aliens".\r\n\r\nEn octobre 2009 il arrive en Russie, pour des questions d''origines, "un vieux rêve de revenir en Russie, avec un attachement personnel, affectif, culturel"… Ce qui lui donne des clefs pour comprendre l''âme slave. Un pays nordique, avec ce que cela entend de retenue de soi, et en même temps des personnalités un peu latines : très affectives, très émotionnelles, même si cela a un peu été caché par la culture soviétique. Mais quand les barrières s''ouvrent, ils sont capables de grande extraversion. C''est une sorte d''Afrique blanche, ou les brésiliens du nord. Un pays quand même à cheval entre l''Europe et l''Asie. Une façon d''être un peu asiatique en regard à la hiérarchie, au langage des signes, au gestuel, aux icônes, aux symboles (la couleur rouge), à la sémiotique. Du coup, en terme de personnalité, ils ont des affinités faciles avec les latins, les français, les italiens, et un peu moins avec les saxons. Quand il a pris ce marché, il ne s''attendait pas autant à un sens aussi fort de la hiérarchie, du respect de l''autorité. De ses idéalismes politiques, il garde le sentiment fort que la Russie n''est pas, aujourd''hui, une démocratie.\r\n\r\nLa génération qui est sa cible est la première qui n''a pas vécu la période soviétique, mais elle a une vision très négative du pouvoir en place, sans pour autant avoir de volonté de toucher les choses. Les quadra, les quinquas qui ont vécu l''ère soviétique n''ont aucune velléité que le pouvoir va changer et ne souhaite même pas être acteur de ce changement. La "creative class", elle, trouve des modes d''expression, d''émancipation. Il y a eu un petit cycle de manifestation lors de la réélection de Poutine, aussi sur les Facebook. Le pouvoir a laissé faire, uniquement en jugulant les potentiels leaders. C''est une génération qui est en "douce rébellion". Il n''y a pas besoin d''underground fort ou de transgression parce que le pouvoir est assez malin pour le tolérer.\r\n\r\nIci les élites culturelles, économiques et politiques sont déconnectées. La creative class n''a pas forcément le pouvoir politique et économique, ils s''en sont même un peu écarté. Les gens qui ont le pouvoir sont souvent les ex-communistes (ex-nomeclatura), qui se sont partagé le gâteau post eltsine, qui ont racheté pour 3 francs six sous des paquets immobiliers… Ils sont souvent déconnectés par rapport à l''élite culturelle aussi. D''où des mécanismes consommateurs intéressants : ils vivent au jour de jour, ils flambent, toutes catégories socio-pro confondues : ce qui est pris est pris, work hard / play hard, ils voyages… Il y a une avidité, une curiosité et une générosité qui les rend des consommateurs flambeurs. La relation à la nature est un peu identique : le pays est si grand que la nature absorbera tout… Même s''il y a une micro tendance dans la creative class (qui vont chez Strelka, à Garage…) à avoir un discours écologique. Il y a de plus en plus d''hybrides, même si ce sont quand même des Porsche Cayenne.\r\n\r\nLa sociabilité et les moments d''alcool sont très important en Russie. Moments de partage, moments à table. Il y a deux gros moments de convivialité : moment en groupe (business, famille, amis), qui est très important ; et un autre moment qui est la consommation en couple, à la maison, qu''ils appellent "relaxant", qui est une sorte d''apéro, assez lourd, où on partage la journée autour de marques internationales : vins, starking, martini, whisky. Il y a encore une véritable célébration du toast, avec un discours plus ou moins long, même si ça se détend un peu et on trinque aussi parfois sans cérémonial, dans les lieux. La creative class n''est pas spécialement en rupture par rapport à ce type de tradition, mais ils switchent.

The kitchen is entirely visible to the customer, only separated by a huge glass front. It is far too fancy to be called a canteen – that is, I guess, supposed to be the funny thing about. They offered 5 different dishes between 3 and 6 euros; they looked fresh, were nicely arranged and it tasted really good.

Clearly, we did not belong here; the outsiders who just come by enjoying their nice place and good food.

The menu and prices are written on two boards, one on each side of the door. On the right side of the door it says: Coffee, tea, etc. and their prices. On the left board one can read: “Brotzeit” with smoked sausage, cheese, or with different pastes/spreads.

Apparently, fishermen preferred this area, not because it was particularly clean, but because it was a very quiet area, as the wall was right there and nobody wanted to hang out there. The group on the pictures said they preferred this spot, because they always caught something there. They preferred to catch “Common Roach” or red eye fish, but they were not very picky about that, as they were just doing it for fun. Every fish they cached was thrown back in the water while still alive, so they said. I never saw them fishing anything, but they say fishing is a sport of patience and I did not stay longer than half an hour. I saw them enjoying the weather and each other’s company. \r\nThe situation was clearly a hangout, a weekly ritual, where the same guys returned every week to the same place.

The fishing includes bringing the fishing poles and preparing the bait to attract the fish. Preparing the bait took a lot of their time. In order to make it, they had to crumble about 10 big pieces of bread with their hands, baguettes, flat breads and dumplings and then mix the crumbles with the rest of the ingredients; corn, vanilla and water\r\nIn order to “pay” for taking pictures of them, I had to collaborate crumbling one of the pieces of bread, as well as letting them take a picture of me. One of the guys mixed all the ingredients in a plastic bag, and another one made balls out of the mix.

This area is well known for its nice bike rides by the canal, small cafes and bakeries and a wide offer of children’s playgrounds.\r\nEven better than the playground’s location, however, is the location of the small ice cream store, exactly in front of it, on the street Weichselstraße.\r\nThe store is only a few steps away from the entrance of the playground, so every parent outside the kids area, had an ice cream on their hand.\r\nIt looked as if it was an everyday ritual, taking the kids to play by the canal, eating ice cream and talking to other parents. A number of about four moms and one dad (or aunts, uncle, or any other relatives of the kids), who were waiting outside the playground were eating ice cream; some mothers that walked on the canal with their baby´s strollers were also enjoying an ice cream; some of the kids were hurrying to eat their ice creams before they melted and go back to play; and some grandmothers were also in the ice cream mood.\r\nAs soon as it gets warm in Berlin, ice cream stores start to pop up everywhere. Regular cafes and bakeries re-open their ice cream fridges only fort he summer time. Ice creams become almost a -must during this time of the year. People all ages and styles are seen on the street eating ice cream.\r\nThe four mothers and one dad hanging out outside the playground were the perfect example of this summer ice cream trend. They seemed very relaxed in their conversation and the ice cream cups and cones looked actually really tempting. They looked as if they definitely knew each other from before, and apparently from hanging out at the same spot every afternoon after school hours. \r\nAfter a few minutes of observation, some of the kids came back from playing and they also bought some ice cream. They all seemed tob e in the same age group, and so did the parents.

The name Fusion describes the blend of theater, cinema, cabaret, and music that go on for four days on this old airfield, surrounded by a beautiful forest. Around a hundred groups, in charge of drinks, food, decoration, logistic, sound systems, etc., work on the festival. In total, more than 2,000 people collaborate in various ways, either paid or ad honorem.\r\nMany of the 40,000 pilgrims that travel to the festival go over, or from Berlin. Some are national pilgrims, from close or far away, whilst others are international. They range between the ages of 4 and 60 years old, as whole families, “festivals experts,” and mostly young people visit the festival.\r\nThe festival takes place in Mecklenburg, more specifically, in an old Russian military airfield near the town of Neustrelitz, about two hours away from Berlin. \r\nThe ways of transport to the festival vary according to origin, time and budget: bus, bike, train, rental or private car; preferably a confortable van with built-in beds and decorations.\r\nFrom Berlin, the most confortable option, using common transportation, was taking the bus of the Festival, the bassliner.org, a transport collective. The buses cost 15 Euros and they leave every 15 minutes from Berlin. Reservations are required, but the buses are very confortable inside: They have reclining seats and small tables, so you can seat face to face with other people on the table and share the space to place drinks and food for the way.\r\nAs I approached the line to wait to get in the bus, I thought I was going to experience total excitement and that people were going to be thrilling to go to the festival. However, everybody seemed annoyed by their own luggage and boxes of beer and wine, nobody was talking loud, and everybody was waiting for the bus very civilized. The collective ecstasies had not started jet.\r\nAs the festival takes place in the middle of nowhere, most of the people tend to carry drinks and/or food, because it’s cheaper. Both drinks and food are sold in the festival, all kinds, from organic tea to Moscow Mule, the trendy drink in Berlin now (gin, ginger ale, ginger, cucumber, tonic water and ice); as well as from nutella crepes to vegan complicated dishes. \r\nWhile waiting for the bus, people talked to each other about logistic of the camping or other people who were going to be present. Some friends seemed to have met there, after having spent a long time without meeting each other, given their warmer greetings and hugs. So booking the bus for the same time seemed like a premeditated idea to do the pilgrimage together to the Fusion.\r\nThe bus left punctual from the Ostbahnhof and went across Berlin towards the forests. Once in the bus, people started drinking beer and chatting. It was easy to determine who came from far away. Even though everybody was speaking German, some kept pointing Alexanderplatz and other touristic attractions of the city while passing by, national tourists. Besides the beers, many travelers took out sandwiches and other snacks for the way.\r\nFusion Festival: http://www.fusion-festival.de/de/2013/home/\r\n\r\nTickets are sold on line, with one year of advance. In order to be able to buy a ticket, people have to participate in a lottery. If you win the lottery, then you can buy a ticket for 80 Euros.\r\nOnce at the festival, you have the possibility of working for 6 hours and get 30 Euros back, and pick up one bag of garbage and get 10 Euros back.

They have a changing day menu with main dishes and a permanent snacks and breakfast menu. Why Turkish-Italian? The owners have Turkish and Italian background, as well as a gastronomy family history.\r\nWe could hear various languages in the place, German, Turkish, some Nordic language that sounded like Finnish or similar, and Spanish. We were the Spanish-speaking table: three friends who went out to dinner and drink some nice wine.\r\nAs we were having a hard time deciding which wine to pick, the waiter made us a small wine tasting. She is definitely the soul of that restaurant, very thoughtful, active, fast and kind. She was always interacting with the costumers, beyond the “What would you like to order?” she was funny, kept making jokes and took her time to advice us on the food and drinks. Without exaggerating, I can say that the waiter really made the night a lot nicer.\r\nThe place was almost full, even though it was just a Wednesday. All tables around us were occupied. The only table that was free was the big one in a slightly separated area, jet in contact with the rest of the restaurant. It is a long table, which invites for big business dinners, birthday celebrations or family gatherings that require some but not total privacy.\r\nWe had a terrific dinner, drank our bottle of Turkish wine, delicious, and talked a lot. The subjects were the usual, work, men, the terrible German weather, housing, sports and yoga. By sports I mean running and swimming, no conversation about teams or manly sports popped that night.\r\nAfter dinner we decided to order some dessert. Again, we did not know what to pick, as everything was home made and looked delicious. This time another costumer, who was also standing by the desserts, advised us. Besides that moment, we did not interact with any other visitor of the restaurant.\r\nWe picked the chocolate-pear cake to share, which was the perfect closure of our dinner. \r\nAfter that we all went home in different directions, either walking or by bike. \r\n\r\nBarini’s web page (http://www.barini-nk.de) shows the daily and permanent menu, offers the possibility of making reservations on line, invites to like the restaurant on facebook (it has over 300 likes), shows some pictures of the place and has a special section: “Barini on Tour”.

Skate by Night is a seasonal series of five skating events that take place during the summer in various streets of Berlin and other German cities. This event had been canceled a couple of times, because of the weather, as it can only take place on dry nights.\r\nThe Double Night owes its name to the two rounds of 11 Km that start and finish at Alexanderplatz, main square of the city. Doing one or two rounds is optional. Everybody, staff and participants, start gathering at six thirty pm, and the first round starts at eight. At this point, the mass of skaters leaves Alexanderplatz and goes on Karl-Marx Allee, the most famous boulevard of Berlin since its construction in times of communist Germany. It is a very wide street that allows a big range of movement for the skaters. It is the same street, where the manifestations of the 17th of June started 60 years ago.\r\nAfter the Karl-Marx Allee the group takes the Straße der Pariser Kommune and the bridge Oberbaumbrücke, both very symbolic places of Berlin. Once the bridge is crossed, the skaters do the second half of the round on the opposite side of the Spree, going over the Oranienstrasse, until they go back to Alexanderplatz. Once there, they take a pause, get a drink and continue to skate with the group that decided to do only one round.\r\nSkaters of all ages and styles are to be seen, some ride in small groups and families, but most of them seem to be going solo in their own rhythm among the group´s rhythm. Slower skaters go on the front, and fast skaters go in the back. Common sense would have said that the opposite way was the right way. However, after years of organizing these events, they have realized that the front mass sets a common rhythm for the majority and the fast really sportive skaters wait back and then speed all they can between the guarding car and the crowd.\r\nDressing styles vary between sportive, almost professional skaters, loosen-up Sunday, 80´s fashion with matching rollerblades and cloth, and chic. Most of the participants seem to be very young, but older people are also to be seen. \r\nAs they all rush on the street, people stops to watch them go by from the sidewalk or come out of their windows to see them and take pictures of the event. The skaters react saying good-bye and laughing.\r\nAll participants pay an amount of two Euros; with this payment they receive a drink, free rental skates and a 10% discount bonus for Café Berger. This café is not on the rout. It seems to be a regular sponsor of the event, where skaters might go for breakfast of coffee any other day (http://www.cafeberger.de). Free in-line skating classes might be taken at the beginning of the event.\r\nThe Skate by Night web page is the following: http://berlin.skatebynight.de/start/\r\nIt contains all the information about how to register, who guards the skaters, a forum, a list of links, sponsors, contact number and facebook (https://www.facebook.com/skatebynightberlin?fref=ts).', 179, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/b8d02f288d769254.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/fab240513c5abbec.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/1273c717e9e78bdc.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/725765af9f31beb6.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/d440520eff368747.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/4d423bba181db419.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"}]', 1),

The voice and main figure of the band sings with a megaphone, instead of a microphone. She has various steps, dances to the music, and also suggests which song they should play next…she is Nova.  The rest of the musicians, all young men with different outfits play the “djungleswing” music, a mix of swing, Balkan and Romanian folk. Each one of the band members had a different style. The clarinet was wearing nothing but sports shorts; he shaved almost his whole head, except for a heart shape of hair on the back. The drummer wore black big glasses and classic style cloth, which in previous times used to characterize nerds; nowadays, he could be described as a hipster. The string instruments wore hats, just as the ones that men fashioned in the 1930’s.\r\nThe strong rhythm and voice attracted many people around them. Spectators sat down on the stairs or stood up in a circle around them. Of course the band had a guitar case opened, where people could deposit their monetary contributions. \r\nOn the stairs, listeners were mostly drinking beer. An empty sect bottle lied on the floor next to a group of girls. The standing audience moved a bit with the rhythm of the music, and a couple of them actually danced, the heroes of the crowd. A girl and a boy, who seemed to be friends in their early 20’s, were the most expressive dancers of the circle. They danced non-stop to every song, ex-changed words and laughs, and even improvised some duo steps. People right next to them also started dancing, as if it was contagious. All dancers showed different styles of dancing and never danced in couples, as in traditional swing dancing.\r\nSwing dancing classes are all over Berlin now a days, with all possible prices, from free-classes, 2 Euros classes, and until 13 – 20 Euros the one-hour class.\r\nThis rhythm has become very popular in the last two years. Swing bands have started to gain more space and fame, not only on the street, but also in bars and cafes. \r\nThis band, Nova fliegt zum Mond, sold their CDs copies with 12 songs for 10 Euros. They sold all the copies they had in a time of about 40 minutes! People kept approaching the guitar case to either drop some coins or take a CD and leave a 10 Euros bill in it.

He has worked in over thirty countries in the last ten years and whenever he is back home, he hangs out in the bar “Taqueria Florian” in Kreuzberg. The Taqueria is his office he says, so we decided to meet there for the interview. I found him reading some scripts and drinking a cappuccino. As soon as we started the interview he changed to white wine.\r\nHe has lived in Berlin in two occasions. The first one was between 2003 and 2006, and the second one started in 2010, so he has lived a total of six years in Berlin. Nonetheless, he knows the city exceptionally well and he always has an interesting plan. Opening art exhibits, new bands playing in small bars, vernissages, house parties and after parties are the most common, as many of his friends also work in the music or art scene and keep exchanging invitations and suggestions about where to go.\r\nHis film career started in 1992. He became director of photography in 1994 and has maintained that title ever since. He works in films and publicity, but he does not consider it work. “Even though it involves a lot of hours of work, you cannot call it work; calling it work, would be a joke” he said. It is a mix between art and work, and as long as you enjoy it, it is not work.\r\nLiving in Berlin but working almost everywhere else in the world has its explanation. The filming and publicity market in Berlin are almost dead, he says, there are only very rare and small projects, nothing particularly interesting (artistically or financially). What Berlin does offer is a very strategic location in Europe and two easy access airports that make travelling a lot easier. This year he has been in Egypt, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania. In these countries, the publicity market is very new, and the calls for interesting work are constant and rewarding. \r\nHis work without Internet would be impossible. Without technology he could not coordinate with his clients, all in different countries; he could not stay in touch with his family and friends all the time; and he could not talk with everybody for free, or for the low prices available on-line. On a daily basis, he does not use the phone too much, he sees it as a “local tool”, mostly a thing of the 20th century to call his friends when he is back in Berlin.\r\nIn order to experience Berlin and its creative scene, there is no other –must- but visiting this neighborhood, Kreuzberg. He did not name a particular bar, food or drink, he mentioned that most important is to “get soaked” in the area. Kreuzberg is not only the most bohemian area of Berlin, he affirms it is the most bohemian area of Germany, and there are not many areas like this one anymore. Important record labels started here in the 1970’s; the growth of electronic music took place right here. The first “green” mayor of history was the environmentalist mayor of Kreuzberg in the 1970’s-1980’s. He could not recall the name of this mayor, but he saw him recently in a demonstration of support to the refugees that live in the area. \r\nBerlin is so particular, because it is the capital of a world power, but it still is very bohemian and alternative. It is slowly changing of course, but it has kept its personality along the years. \r\nThe trend that is going to change the personality of Berlin has nothing to do with art, movies or fashion. It has to do with the European economic crisis, which has forced many European citizens to abandon their cities and move to countries of growing economies like Germany. Berlin is receiving masses of immigrants and tourists, as it has also gained fame in the last years. This migration is turning the city more cosmopolitan, but also more “fashionista”. The grunge style of Berlin is starting to change for a more elaborated and more expensive one. Wild bars and clubs, like Berghaim for example, are starting to become a touristic attraction. In this way, they are also starting to become more stereotypical. Regular bars in Kreuzberg now, are fuller of people than ever before. \r\nThis phenomena is not only affecting nightlife, a gentrification process is almost out of control. Rents are rising and artists, musicians and traditional neighbors of the area are moving away. In 2006 you could choose where you wanted to live, you could even occupy a whole building and nobody would care. Nowadays, people are fighting for the smallest apartments in this area.\r\nNot everything is negative though, important Start-ups have grown in Berlin in the last years, and they give new creative perspectives to the city. All this new fashionism has also attracted important fashion shows to the city, which may be an interesting turn for Germany.\r\n“I don´t think every day rituals have changed much” he said. We keep going out for dinner a lot, as eating out in Berlin has never been expensive, and we keep going to bars to meet. The good thing of this city is that it is not too big, so you do not need to be calling your friends on the phone all the time. It is very easy to meet up. Consumption habits have not changed much either; a lot of alcohol and a big variety of drugs keep characterizing the city.\r\nThe only tradition that disappeared in the last couple of years, that he could recall, is the Love Parade, but it was time to move on already.\r\nDramatic changes are coming in the next five to ten years though; unemployment, underemployment and exploitation are only going to keep rising. Arturo does not think people are going to be able to enjoy them selves very much in ten years. They are going to be frustrated with the situation. The “North Atlantic Treaty” and the “Transpacific Partnership”, the TPP, are not going to let new generations enjoy the future. \r\nThe digital era will keep developing, not even very old people are going to watch TV anymore. Internet is going to absorb all kinds of communication and slowly, influence almost every kind of socialization.', 187, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/d2ad4f2802c69d2f.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/b3a9698a2a8dbd32.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/d20a1dffd3068951.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/5ef535df9889a78f.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/fa8629f8ffaa9035.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/a27562eb10238de7.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"}]', 1),

This almost isolation of the rest of the city helped it develop its very alternative personality. Once the wall was tore down, it started to become the bohemian area it is today. \r\nOne of the best distractions of this place is watch people passing by, as this is one of the most mixed and interesting neighborhoods of Berlin.\r\nSeating here can always signify seeing some of the eccentric people of Berlin in action. The character of today was a guy on his bicycle, which had a built-in coffee table. He ordered coffee to the waiter, but he only used his own furniture (his bike and a big paring bollard). His outfit was outstanding, cowboy boots, a red leather glove and a white hat. He was writing on a very small notebook and looked very inspired. Jet he was glad to pose for a picture. \r\nIn front of him were two girls, drinking the house pilsner beer, half a litter each. They were young, around 24 years old, dressed casually with worn out t-shirts, pants and tattoos. They seemed very absorbed in their own conversation and did not interact with the character in front of them or any other person of the bar. Both were English speakers, did not understand a word in German but were proud of living in Berlin.\r\nTheir case is not rare in Kreuzberg, as it was always, since its beginnings, an immigrant’s neighborhood. The neighborhood is separated in two areas that correspond to two postal codes. The hip area of it, filled with bars, cafes and nightclubs is called the SO 36 (South-East, 36). The Bateau Ivre is a symbol of this area. Therefore, it is a place to be seen at. Seating there, drinking, talking to friends, is the thing to do in any season. During warm days, most of the people seats on the tables outside, where you usually share long typical German tables with other unknown people. I saw people drinking beer, coffee, tea and juices in the afternoon. During the night, it is more common to see people drinking cocktails. \r\nDuring the colder seasons, you can still be seen from the outside, as the place has huge windows that allow people from Kreuzberg and visitors to look inside.', 189, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/f58481b73daa823a.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/d31483bce42d9d1d.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/781a543185e1b7da.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/49ad28c5b424af3a.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/b2b4803a77d5bee4.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"}]', 1),

During very sunny days, the square is really crowded. Its attractiveness is its location, otherwise it is nothing but a small piece of grass right on the canal and on “Kottbusser Damm”, the avenue that connects Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Neukölln, hip neighbourhoods of Berlin. \r\nThe square may look insignificant, but the architecture around it is the most cherished by Berliners, the so called “Alt-Bau”: Four to six stories buildings, magnificent decorated windows, balconies with wrought-iron railings, old arches above the big doors and spacious apartments with stucco and wooden floors. However, the “Alt Bau” architecture is not the only beauty of this area. This tiny square is surrounded by bars, cafes, street markets (Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays) and alternative movie theaters. The closest metro station is only a few minutes away walking and bikers have plenty of parking spaces around the square. \r\nSelf-glorification, chin wagging, hanging out and eating together, were all taking place on the square when I passed by.\r\nVarious small groups were seating on this little square at the end of the afternoon. Most of them sat on the grass and talked to each other. Others preferred doing head stands, performing acrobatic jumps and running around. \r\nThis small group of four youngsters, two girls and two boys, between the ages of 19 and 23 more or less, were helping each other practice some outstanding positions and jumps. One of them was a real expert; he was so fast I never got a picture of his mortal jumps. He was helping the others do head stands and giving them indications before they practiced their jumps. The rest of the “acrobats” seemed to have different levels, and only one of them kept screaming it was her first time doing this, while standing feed overhead.\r\nThe rest of the people on the square were older, but not older than 30 – 35. Nobody seemed particularly interested or bothered by the acrobats.\r\nThere was a pair of two guys who were talking to each other, while playing with their phones. There was also a pair of two girls who were eating together. Their picnic consisted of a big package of French fries that looked freshly made, as if they had bought it on “Kottbusser Damm” a few minutes ago. And so, there were many pairs and small groups seatig, talking and drinking. The bigger groups consisted of four people. One of these four-people groups had brought blankets and drinks from home, a big thermos and water.

That’s what it says on the big banner of Berlin’s Taksim Square representation. A manifestation of support to the demonstrations in Istambul’s Taksim Square was built up in Berlin. A military green tent, pictures of the demonstrators in Istambul, banners and chairs constitute the Taksim of Berlin. An improvised wooden signal identifies the square “Taksim Platz”, but the Gezi Park is of course missing. \r\n“GEGEN FACHISMUS” is the other small banner that I could understand, “against fascism”. Otherwise, I could not understand any of the banners on the square, as they were all written in Turkish. They did have flyers in German though, which explained they were there to support manifestations against authoritarian governments worldwide. \r\nPeople were seating in a circle, mostly talking to each other and drinking coffee. The coffee was served by one of the organizers of the demonstration, who kept going in the tent to get cups of coffee for all the people present. Two of the participants were very focused in their devices, a computer and a tablet. One girl in her 30’s had a laptop and was opening her Internet navigator. A guy had a tablet on, but he moved it away when I came closer. So, I could not see if they were using any social media or whatsapp to communicate to other demonstrators in Germany or the World. I also did not get to listen to the “Capulcu Tencere”, which is the app that simulates the noise made by protesters who support the movement in Turkey (used in Turkey and later used in Brazil in a Portuguese version).\r\nActually, Greek music was playing. It was the introduction for this afternoon’s guests, a group of Greek activists who devote their work for the fight against repressive governments. The leader of the group spoke in Greek, but he had a translator to German seating next to him.\r\nSmoking cigarettes and drinking lots of coffee seem to be too stereotypical to describe this Turkish-Greek-German gathering. However, coffee rounds did not seem to have an end, and almost every second person was either rolling or smoking tabacco. People on the Taksim Platz were between the ages of 20 and 50 years old. The majority was in their late 30’s-40’s, and the speakers were younger than most of the attendants.\r\nBesides a demonstration, it looked like a hanging out situation, where many people knew each other, probably from seating there every day discussing politics.\r\nThis scene attracted a lot of new visitors, who would pass by and stand up looking at them. These new visitors did not seem to dare and come sit down with the rest of the “established demonstrators”; they stayed on the periphery of the circle. Even on the periphery, they were offered coffee.

I got to meet their ‘Head of Content’ and talked about the current trends concerning photosharing and virtual communities. \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/EyeEm?ref=br_rs\r\nhttp://www.eyeem.com/\r\n\r\nSince communicating and expressing oneself through pictures is one of the key ways of conviviality today, I decided to meet Severin M., who has worked for this company from the very beginning. Severin was born and raised in Vienna; he went to school there and after that, he earned a Masters in Philosophy from the University of Vienna. He also studied in Paris for a year. He wrote his master thesis on photography, with a focus on the transformation from analog to digital media. After finishing his studies he worked for Lomography – a company that has become part of an analog camera movement and community – for a couple of years, being involved in different photo-book projects. About three years ago he moved to Berlin, still involved with Lomography and created a photo-book (something he had already done in Vienna a couple of years ago): a Berlin city-guide. Two years ago, he decided to move from analog to digital photography and started to work at EyeEm. EyeEm is a photo-sharing application that focuses on creating worldwide communities based on high quality and content related pictures. Today, Severin works as ‘Head of Content and Community’ at EyeEm.\r\n\r\nSeverin tells me that uploading and sharing photos online is a completely new marked that did not exist five years ago. Even today business is growing rapidly each year or even each week, visible in the rising numbers of pictures and video uploads. In order to understand what is going on here, it is very important to keep in mind how photography has changed in recent years. What is taking place is a kind of democratization of photography and art. Today most people in the Western world have a high-quality cameras integrated in their smartphones. Most of them are taking and uploading tons of pictures to express and archive their experiences. That has completely changed the field of photography and blurred the line between professionals and the lay photographer. The content of the picture has become more and more important and its esthetic aspect is only an additional element. Photos are increasingly becoming a way of communication, self-expression and even political activism. \r\n\r\nAccording to Severin, uploading tools like EyeEm and Instagram are a key element in this development. There are new trends everywhere in this fast-moving market. At the moment one of the hottest platforms is ‘Snapchat’. http://www.snapchat.com/ \r\nThis app is based on the idea of chatting through photos and gained 80 million registered users in 8 months. Since every photo is deleted after a couple of seconds, Snapchat is a completely new way of interaction. Severin tells me that many people are known to use this platform as some kind of a sex chat since they don’t  have to bear any consequences. \r\n\r\nThe biggest player in the scene is still Instagram with more than 100 million registered users. Due to their importance, they were taken over by Facebook a year ago. Generally, companies are coming and going in this market. One thing that helps, however, is being big already. Then you can simply become part of a trend or hype. That is how Severin would explain part of the success of Instagram. Something similar happened to EyeEm as well. In the US, where they have most of their users, they have been ranked very high (top 30) in the download charts for quite some time and that helped a lot in getting new users. A good ranking in the app store is essential for short-term success in this market. Also, he tells me that for some reason they have become very popular among black teenagers and that this group has made up a growing number of users ever since. Even though this was not an intended strategy, apps and the communities they create become related to specific groups. Understanding these groups, the way they communicate and share their experiences, is the second way to success in this business. That is why creating and supporting communities is the central strategy of EyeEm. \r\n\r\nEyeEm primarily focuses on creating communities, by offering specific tagging tools and a high-quality technology. What makes their app unique is an automatic tagging option. If you take a picture of a place, the app automatically adds the location you’re at and gives you a number of options of what you might be doing here. Severin takes a picture of Raja Jooseppi, the place we met for the interview. The app realized that we are in a café and Severin picks “chatting” as one of the tag options. Then he shows me that 15 other photos have already been taken of EyeEm-users here. We go through the pictures to get a feeling of what the others had been doing at this place. He tells me, that the automatic tagging option is central for the success of EyeEm, because it allows users to peak around and get to know and see new things they are looking for. Thus, it connects quite different people and places on the basis of pictures. In this context, EyeEm is also quite interesting if you want to know something about people or places that you do not have regular excess to. For example, if you type ‘Taksim Square’ you get tons of pictures of what is going on there. Generally, the vision of EyeEm is to become the YouTube of photo-sharing. You just type in some keywords and then you get what you need: A nice picture showing you the place and experience you are looking for. It is somehow similar to the principle of ‘google-images’ but it is much more specific. You have fewer photos but better ones and they are related to people of the EyeEm community.      \r\n\r\nThe second focus of EyeEm is the maintenance of photo-sharing communities. Severin tells me that in a market like this you need to have something people really identify with. If your app has a feature that is copied by every competitor, you can go down from one month to another. You can only become a sustainable product in this market if a group of people feels really committed to you. EyeEm contains hundreds of photo-sharing communities and the company is very eager to support and promote them. Severin tells me that many such virtual communities regularly meet up in real life and that he is going to one of these meetings as an EyeEm representative the coming weekend. It is important to know what the communities want and need in order to keep them happy and committed. Generally, the EyeEm strategy appears to be quite sustainable and successful, since they stately gain about 1 million new users every month.\r\n\r\nSeverin tells me that by focusing on tagging and community-building, EyeEm becomes increasingly exposed to legal issues and problems. Particularly young people have become so used to share photos online, that they don’t have a clear concept of personal property anymore. They use pictures the way other people use words and don’t think about the fact that they belong to someone. Online pictures are clearly creating a new way of communication, especially for young people. \r\n\r\nAsking Severing about traditional forms of conviviality similar to photo-communities in the past, it takes quite some time for him to answer. He then tells me that he cannot come up with something that comes even close to what is going on at the moment. After all, inviting people to watch photos and slides form your holiday or creating a photo-book is very different from being part of a photo-community. Today you don’t just take pictures and show them around but the processes of production and reception have become directly linked.  \r\n\r\nTalking about new trends and potential developments, Severin predicts that all online communities become much more photo-based. Also, professional photographers will reappear in this newly formed market. He tells me that he talked to a guy who has millions of followers on Instagram who does not take the pictures for fun but somehow knows what people want and like. For this, the man has a professional photo account in order to get a large group of followers. In this position as “multiplier” he is approached by businesses, e.g. from the field of tourism, that pay him money (or pay for a vacation) so he can take pictures that are good promotion for them. \r\n\r\nSo some people as well as companies have realized the business potential of online-photo sharing and community building. A new market for “real stock photos” has emerged. At EyeEm, people get a notification, if someone is interested in their photo.

Most people were dressed up in dresses, shirts and even suits, only a few wearing only jeans and a T-shirt. Many were wearing very preppy clothes and seemed to be from well-off families, a lot of them young people, maybe 19 years old. They dominated the scene, walking around chatting and shouting in a smug kind of way.\r\n\r\nFoodwise, the main attraction was a burger grill where everybody could get their basic burgers broiled before they could choose from a whole bunch of toppings and sides at a large buffet and add it to their meat and buns individually. The rest of the buffet was American-style as well with coleslaw, brownie muffins, cookies, etc. on plastic plates. We got the drinks for free too, which comprehended not only non-alcoholic juices and water plus wine and beer but also all sorts of cocktails mixed by two young bartenders in hats. All the young people seemed to know each other as did most of the other guests. Not many people were eating, most only had drinks. \r\n\r\nDJs were playing music to a largely empty room at first – given the nice weather outside, when at 10 p.m. the actual release took place. Therefore, all parties involved into the production of the video in any kind (directors, actors, musicians,…) were asked to come onto the stage to watch their final product. Everybody was cheering at the end of the presentation, the catering company’s boss thanking them for their commitment and nice job. By then, the room was full and people started dancing to the music of two new young DJs, also friends of the large group of youngsters.

If you are not part of the group or some kind of a professional skater or BMX rider, it is pretty tough to ‘get in’. Not so at ‘Park am Gleisdreieck’ at the border of Berlin Kreuzberg just five minutes away from Potsdamer Platz.  Here you can find an interesting mix of youngsters and BMX as well as skateboarder groups having fun in front of a mixed audience having coffee in the sun. \r\n\r\nThe skating area is located next to a busy path connecting one part of the park with another. A lot of people, especially families, come by and watch. One time I could see a BMX guy doing a 360 directly in front of a mother with a baby in a stroller. She did not panic but seemed to realize that the guy knows what he is doing. A lot of families come by with their kids, who check out the ramps with their scooters or skateboards.  One time I saw three kids approaching two BMX guys who were just chilling next to a bench after having had quite a good and exhausting run through the ramps. They appeared to enjoy being adored by the youngsters, who entered the park after one of the guys told them that they are going to take a break for now. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of the scene is the café which is located on the opposite side of the skate park. Parents and other people are sitting around here chatting while having coffee and cake. You can even find some people in their 60s and 70s who watch the performances on the ramp with interest and curiosity. The café has even put out some canvas chairs facing the skate park, which are only separated from it by the small path. The skaters and BMX riders clearly enjoy the mixed crowd watching them. Many BMX guys use the path just in front of the café to do most of their tricks, even though there is plenty of space in the back of the skate park. At the same time, it does not look so much like people are being competitive. They seem to just play and have fun. In the end a couple of families and older couples are not the kind of audience you need to risk everything just to show off. \r\n', 197, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/56c9e707f6dd8f65.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/b8b1cfaccaa4bc5e.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/8b2d5f903ec4a918.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/9a5e1f3f7167a9a9.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/2c9bfd861d7580bf.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/4ecd2aa2a32bbea4.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/539c780d5dee91ac.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/ea8c255cc19790ce.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/18d1574bd5c4af19.jpeg"}]', 1),

Rosa Luxemburg was also injured here at the same time, but she was taken to a bridge near by, the Lichtensteinsbrücke, and from there she was thrown in the water.\r\nThe place is quite idyllic though; chestnut trees and a nice big lake, the “Neuen See”, surround it. In the lake are two attractions, rental rowing boats and the DJ of the café. The DJ plays music from a special little tower from where he can see everybody and everybody can see him. The music was chill-out, mostly very soft electronic, which did not play too loud. \r\nThis “café am Neuen See” is surprisingly big for its location. The streets around this part of the park are so quiet, it is hard to imagine that such a big place with over 80 big wooden tables outside and a DJ in the water is there. Nonetheless it is there and it gets very crowded during the summer time. Buying beers took about 10 minutes and the line for the food looked pretty long. They offer various kinds of beer, wines, and simple German food, such as potatoes salad, Wiener or polish sausage, and home made pretzels, as well as pizza. \r\nIn the middle of the crowds and right on the lake I found a small secret society. Two guys who went on one of the rental rowing boats and started chatting there without rowing. After a while, three of their friends approached them and wanted to get on the boat, but the first two would not let them in. They would move the boat a lot, so that it became unstable and scary for the new ones. After a few minutes of playing, two of them finally managed to get on the boat, a girl and a boy. The third one was left out, maybe because the boat was quite small and it looked like it would not take more weight (the water lavel came over half of the boat’s height). \r\nThis third guy just sat down on the dock and kept talking to his friends on the boat. The ones on the boat kept making the boat stumble and play that they were going to leave on the boat and leave him alone. They were all between 25 and thirty something, were nicely dressed, still very casual, very summery. None of them had a beer on their hands, so I suppose they had drank already or were on their way to.\r\nAll details about the Menu, drinks and prices are found online on the café’s web page: http://www.cafe-am-neuen-see.de\r\nInformation about the upcoming Oktoberfest celebrations and options for the winter are also there.

Mostly young people, 20-35 years old, couples, mixed companies, very casual dressed: t-shirts, shorts, sneakers (a lot of Nike!), dresses with sneakers, a few amazing designers looks, timeless cocktail dresses with heels (but not many), mostly dressed calmly and comfortable for dancing.

Even the sought-after front row seats were not occupied by VIPs here because they usually visit only the main shows of the famous designers. Sustainable fashion has not yet made it to the mainstream. \r\nStill, the guests felt special visiting something as urban and extraordinary as a fashion show. Most came in groups of two, exchanging opinions about the models and the fashion they presented.

So there is a subculture with very active kind of socialization. There are large 5-bedroom apartments with huge doors, high ceilings, cross-cutting rooms, which were transformed into workshops. Between the flats there is a "back" door or the secret entrance, through which residents go to each other, and there is also a fridge and other stuff. Flatmates are cooking together, doing yoga, drinking tea, even sculpt. There is supported clean and  close attitude to food, keeping the convenient rhythm of work and relax. It is believed that our apartment is mostly kind of a tearoom, and above us — a bar, but alcohol is not really popular.\r\n\r\nThis evening, in addition to the well-established tradition of baking pies at the midnight we had a group of people leaving for the Burning Man Festival in America.

Many of them were familiar on the Rainbow or had common interest as tea, buddhism, art, travel so on. They cooked and ate pizza non stop, drank tea and herb drinks, that Dasha collects in a village in the Tver region.

Peter is not his real name, but he asked me to use his pseudonym when writing this report. The reason I interviewed him is because I do not know anybody else who can party as hard as him and still have a "normal life" with work, sports, a house and a husband. Peter J. knows every club in Berlin, or at least every club that offers good electronic music and an opened minded dance floor. When he wants to dance, he goes to “Berghaim”, “Berghaim” is one of his favourites and a representative sample of what Berlin is, because of its diversity, particular opening hours, amazing artists and hedonism. The club, moreover, is not a gay club but it is also not a straight club, very Berlin he said.\r\nBesides clubbing, he goes to parks and other outdoor places when he wants to socialize, mostly to “Volkspark Friedrichshain”, “Görli“ (Görlitzer Park) and “Hackescher Markt“. All three are very nice outdoors options where all kinds of people get to meet. However the tendency is that the “Volkspark Friedrichshain” is more young family-type, “Görli” is more the marihuana-smoking type, and “Hackescher Markt” is more the fancy cafes and nice stores area.\r\nRegarding new tendencies in Berlin, he talked about gentrification and its effects. With this process the prices have started to rise and the creative spirit of the city is starting to leave. People who make the city diverse have began to emigrate, as many creatives do not earn thousands a month or do not like to spend thousands in the rent. The areas of “Kreuzberg“, “Neukölln“ and “Fridrichshain“ are going to leave their bohemian or alternative characteristics in the past and start becoming yuppies. The alternative movements and trends are going to migrate to the north part oft he city, to “Wedding“.\r\nThe other trend of Berlin that is worth mentioning, and the one he actually finds astonishing, is the fetiche trend. It is fascinating that a city hosts so many spaces for people to enjoy their fetiches. People does not have to stay in private places to let their fetiches and fantasies go wild; they can enjoy these with other people in various clubs and bars. This fetiche trend is “sordid berliner“ he said.\r\nPlaces not to miss in the city are definitely the area of “Kreuzberg“ and the “Mauerpark“ during the weekends. At night, an amazing place, which is not a must, but a very unique place is “Lab.Oratory“. \r\n“Lab.Oratory“ is a very unusual attribute in the city. An eccentric club if you can call it a club. In this place you are allowed to do all kinds of experiments and enjoy it. What seems to be banned is to be fully dressed, unless it’s rubber. Otherwise, you may do, and you are wished to do whatever you want. This place even has a feature that offers urine showers to those who find it pleasant. People all ages are to be seen there. Peter mentioned all kinds of styles and outfits. Some poeple looks like they are total junkies who hang out there a lot, and some others seem to be highly educated with normal nine-to-five jobs. How can you see this difference if most of the people are half naked and wearing unsual outfits? Apparently you get to talk and meet many. On one night you get to meet at least five people, and because of the language they use in the conversations is easy to determine how they are and how much “world experience“ they might have. \r\nThe catalyser of all these encounters is definitely alcohol, mostly beer, but other drugs are usually around too, it’s Berlin. Drinking beer is seen in most of the places he likes, including bars, eccentric clubs, parks and markets.\r\nInformation about event’s calenders, upcoming parties, special guests and performances going on in the clubs are mostly found on line.\r\nHe has access to –illegal parties webpages- of Berlin, where a profile and password are required to access the locations and Djs informations. Of course he did not tell me how to get to those web pages, but he mentioned “Resident Advisor” (http://www.residentadvisor.net/events.aspx?ai=34) and siegessaeule.de (queer Berlin) as the best webs to get to know Berlins nightlife. Even though he checks “Siegessäule”, the gay magazine of Berlin, quite often, he does not tend to go to gay parties that much, he prefers “mixed” venues.\r\nHe uses his computer and his Samsung Galaxy phone to check out what is going on. He also has a profile on Resident Advisor, which allows him to check the guest lists of every event and confirm or deny his own participation. The weakness of residentadvisor.net is that it does not have a mobile version.\r\nTalking about mobile versions of web pages and technology led us to talk about future trends. He visualizes massive parties going on in various parts of the city at the same time: the DJ mixes music in one place, and many parallel parties spread around the city, dancing to the same music.

In Moscow, hundreds of thousands people on Friday go to their homes in the Moscow region, and many in the nearby area to spend the weekend. Moreover, many of the residents of Moscow itself on Friday did not go to their apartments, and in their country houses — to the Dacha, or Cottage. It''s like a national holiday. More than 80 percent of Russians, according to research by the State Statistical Center, spend their holidays at the Dacha. And the same 80 percent use a dacha for growing horticultural crops, such as potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, berries and onions. \r\n\r\nHistorically, this happened 200—300 years ago, when the famous historian Nikolai Karamzin wrote about his amazed that Moscow is empty in summer — many people went to the country to be closer to nature. Culture cottage holiday has evolved rapidly. Most cottages were issued to employees for good performance. Cottage in the Russian language like with the word "gift." And now, again, according to official statistics, every second inhabitant of Moscow has a summer house — Dacha. My parents and my grandfather also have it. About 100 kilometers from Moscow, and you''re in another world — without cars, gasoline and crowds. However, on Friday to train people so many times that some do not have time to go out on their station, making our way through the crowd.

They practice together in the meditation centre or at retreats in the Kaluga region. They all share a common interest in buddhism. This school is very popular in Russia. It appeared here just at a crossroads after the Perestroyka time, when the road to orthodoxy for young people was unclear and vague, plus it was a time of heavy drugs. I think this organization really has helped to many people somehow to understand the situation and change something in their lives.

The place is located in Kreuzberg and I had already passed by a couple of times. I was always wondering why so many people were standing in line just to get a Turkish sandwich, even though there are hundreds of other decent places close by. I talked about this place with a friend and he told me that going to Mustafa is more than just having a kebab: it is a unique social event. So I decided to check this out myself. Standing in a line of about 50 people, I got to meet Andi K., an architecture student from Vienna. After chatting with her for about 5 minutes, I interviewed her about this whole ‘standing in line thing’ the ‘unique experience’ at Mustafa’s. She agreed and we had a very interesting conversation. \r\n\r\nAndi is 27 years old and has been living in Berlin for about a year now. She is an architecture student who has lived and studied Vienna, Barcelona and Berlin. Andi is originally from Hungary but has spent most of her life in Austria. She came to Berlin a year ago, because she was about to finish her Master’s and wanted to see if this was the right place for her to live and work. Also, a lot of her friends, whom she got to know in Vienna and Barcelona, live in Berlin at the moment. Andi tells me that it is very important to her to already be part of a community when coming to a big city like Berlin. At the moment she is working freelance as an architect, mostly for an architecture firm in Kreuzberg.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I wanted to know was how long she already goes to visit Mustafa’s. Andi told me that it started about a year ago. At that time she met her friend Maria for lunch who works for a startup company nearby. Maria introduced her to Mustafa’s as ‘the best doner’ in the city and they went there more than once during Andi’s stay in Berlin. Since Andi has moved to Berlin, she and Maria go there quite often for their lunch breaks. They don’t mind standing in line for 30 to 40 minutes, even though it eats up almost their entire lunch break.  \r\n\r\nWhen asked why she does not go to another place, Andi tells me that she had tried some but wasn’t impressed. Also, she says that going to Mustafa is more than just having a Döner. Mustafas is a place and a concept you identify with. Going there you feel as being part of a group who knows what is going on in the city. Andi starts telling me a long story about Mustafa’s and how it became so successful. Trying to make a long story short: A couple of years ago two business students, focusing on advertisement, got to know the new owner of Mustafa’s. They were impressed by his high quality standards and his focus on regional products. As a result, they decided to do an interactive website of Mustafas Gemüse Kebab as part of their Master’s exam. The website is an interesting mix of typical local scenes and jokes that play around with Turkish clichés: http://mustafas.de/\r\n\r\nFor example, on the website you can find a guy with a guitar telling you that he ‘will play for Döner’. As soon as you click on his icon, he starts to play a short rock song about how much he likes Döner. There is also a security camera on the homepage. When you click on it you get live pictures from Mustafa’s and every 10 seconds someone is posing into the camera. A lot of people obviously know about the homepage. Two years ago, Andi tells me, the advertisement guys – who founded the advertising agency ‘Dojo’ in between – also produced a funny TV spot for Mustafa’s. It is basically toying with a lot of German stereotypes about Turkish people and it is also a parody of a very famous commercial for baby food, which has been on TV for about two decades. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay898gbNDgg\r\n\r\nListening to all the details Andi knows about this place, I couldn’t help but notice her enthusiasm and excitement. According to Andi, you don’t just go to Mustafa’s because it is a hip spot. She tells me that going to Mustafa and knowing all these details about makes you feel to be part of an in-group. She goes there regularly to meet friends and hang out. It is just like going to a restaurant: After ordering, you wait for your food which giving you plenty of time to chat. Also, according to Andi, the crowd that visits Mustafa’s regularly consists of people who are into good quality and nice company. You can tell: This is a crowd Andi likes to belong to and feels comfortable to identify with. \r\n\r\nAsking Andi, why having a Turkish sandwich can become such a big social event, she gives me a couple of reasons: Today, there is just too much to choose from. As soon you find a place you feel comfortable with, you hang on to it. However, the place has to be something special – something you can talk about with your friends when they ask you about the best spot in your neighborhood.  Andi gives me a nice example concerning this phenomenon. A few weeks ago her parents, who live in a small village in Hungary, came visiting her. First thing she showed them in Berlin was not one of the standard tourist sites but Mustafa’s. Even though they had to wait about 40 minutes, her parents loved it. It was not so much the food they liked, but they got the feel to be part of a typical Berlin experience. Back home, this would be the first story her parents told to their friends. \r\n\r\nThis brings us to the question of how this phenomenon evolved and if this whole ‘standing in line thing’ marks a new path concerning conviviality. You wouldn’t expect the young and well-educated urban professionals to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a Döner if there are hundreds of similar placed around. Again, Andi tells me that going to Mustafa’s she feels to be part of a community. When she came to Berlin everything was new and interesting but at the same time she was looking for stuff she could relate to. When she got to know Mustafa’s and the whole story around it – the business idea, the homepage, the funny commercial – she somehow wanted to become a part of this story. According to Andi this is definitely a new way of conviviality that is rapidly growing. She says that the famous techno club ‘Berghain’ in Berlin Friedrichshain follows a somehow similar concept. There are a lot of interesting stories about this place and that make it something special. The huge queue in front of the club – they often make you wait more than an hour – is simply the price you pay to become part of this myth. \r\n\r\nBut Andi also tells me, that the whole crowd-building is also a problem. In the case of Mustafa’s, more and more people start to say that people only go there because of the crowd they see. Seeing a long line, they simply conclude that Mustafa’s is a tourist place and not a cool spot at all. However, according to Andi, this is not true at all. Tourists come to that place but most of them don’t really enjoy it. They complain about the crew working too slowly and are mostly not too impressed by the food. For Andi, they clearly do not realize what this place is about. It is about being part of a myth and a community. That is why Andi does not believe that crowds, like the one in front of Mustafa’s or the Berghain are simply reflecting frequently changing trends. On the contrary, these crowds have become a relatively stable phenomenon.  Hypes come and go but some crowds appear to shape the city more permanently. The special thing about them is that they are about identity and community. According to Andi, this is a typical development that she could also observe in Vienna and Barcelona. In this context, online platforms and social networks are becoming more and more important in creating and maintaining these myths.    \r\n  \r\n', 272, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/8581a196c4d2a9a4.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/e96887c184b6ae26.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/ba0feb1cd15cb5b6.jpg"}]', 1),

Living close to this new startup space, I got an invitation as a resident. On it you could read that Factory is interested in getting to know their neighbors, especially other businesses. Obviously they also wanted to keep their neighbors calm. \r\n\r\nApproaching the scene, there was already a huge line outside; the organizers were very busy deciding about whom to let in. As soon as we entered, we were walking through dark and shabby corridors and up a few run-down staircases. Taking a right we spotted two bars where you could get a number of tequila cocktails for free, which turned out to be promotion for ‘Sierra Tequila’. A lot of people were gathering around the bar. However, they were not in a hurry or fighting for free drinks but primarily into chatting and getting to know each other. \r\n\r\nUpstairs, a large room opened up with a DJ-desk and a dancefloor. There was also another bar where you could get Becks, wine and all kinds of cocktails. Here, the guests had to pay for the drinks. However, many people came to the bar with some kind of coupons for which they received free drinks. At that point, I realized that the crowd primarily consisted on young business people presumably being part of the Berlin startup scene. It was not the hip crowd you normally see at such parties, the tattooed bartenders being the only exception.  A lot of the guys were wearing polo shirts and many girls nice dresses. You got the impression that these were primarily business people dressed ‘casually’. The crowd was very international with an equal distribution of men and women, which is unusual for the dominantly male startup scene. Most were in their late 20s and early 30s but there were also quite a lot of people in their 40s and 50s. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was not so much shouting out: Party! Instead, most of the young entrepreneurs were busy chatting with each other and meeting new people. Also, you could see a lot T-shirts, buttons or bags with startup business logos or slogans on it. All in all, the event appeared to be some new kind of a company party. Instead of restricting the event to your company, you invited all startups who belong to the scene and let them bring their friends. That way, young professionals get to know the companies and people they might want to work for.    \r\n', 274, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/14feb0b1c0e099e3.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/a4721738f435b72c.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/2a82651c6d8397af.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/3fd10023ff3ebf5b.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/9a8db8e84d56b6ef.jpg"}]', 1),

Il est toujours entouré, toujours occupé, discutant avec tout le monde, virevoltant d’une personne à l’autre. Lorsque j’ai enfin réussi à retenir son attention, ma demande l’a surprit : il ne voyait pas très bien ce qu’il allait pouvoir me raconter. Mais peut-être cela tenait à l’heure avancée de la nuit, car le lendemain lorsque nous nous sommes retrouvé, la conversation était fluide.\r\n\r\nIl m’avait donné rendez-vous dans un café d’une rue calme, à proximité d’une des principales artères du centre de Berlin. L’endroit était inattendue : il y avait une petite terrasse en plein soleil au bord d’un parc. A mon arrivée, Manuel passe commande d''une guiche et d''un jus à la rhubarbe à une jeune fille en short qui parlait avec un accent sud américain. Je commande la même chose.\r\n\r\nManuel a 35 ans, il fait partie de cette génération qui s’est installé à Berlin après la chute du mur, et voit la ville changer à toute vitesse. Des changements qui souvent vont de pair avec leur vie personnelle : “A partir du moment où je me suis installé, je me suis crée mon monde. Je me défini comme étant la somme des choses que je fais”.\r\nManuel est un garçon très élégant, toujours tiré à 4 épingles. Il a un petit air de dandy, avec un sourire toujours accroché aux lèvres. Et c’est avec ce même sourire qu’il répond à mes questions : ”J’ai une formation en chant classique et en architecture. La plupart du temps, je travaille sur des projets où il s’agit de scénographie des lieux, mais il m’arrive aussi de rénover des appartements pour des particuliers. Je me défini plutôt comme un artiste car souvent je monte mes propres projets, soit tout seul, soit collectivement… parallèlement, je travaille aussi avec un collectionneur privé. Il possède plus d’une centaine d’oeuvres picturales du 15ème et 16ème siècles, et il faut s’en occuper quand elles sont exposées quelque part.”\r\n\r\n“ Mon dernier moment de convivialité, c’était hier soir, je trainais au bar du Themrock, lorsque j’ai voulu partir, j’ai rencontré une amie, et nous avons commencé à parler. En fait, il m’arrive beaucoup de choses dans les bars, et les restaurants. Par exemple, le collectionneur pour lequel je travaille, je l’ai rencontré comme ça. A l’époque, je gagnais ma vie en faisant le service dans un restaurant, c’était un client, et lors d’une conversation, je lui racontais ce que je faisais, les projets que j’avais… et que je ne voulais pas travailler dans un bureau d’architectes. Quelques semaines plus tard, il m’a propose de travailler pour lui. Cet homme a d’ailleurs été déterminant dans ma vie puisque c’est grâce à lui qu’Ali et moi avons ouvert le restaurant du Themrock. Sans lui, ce lieu n’existerait pas. Themrock, on l’a imaginé comme un concept, ce n’est pas un restaurant classique, c’est comme venir dîner chez des amis. On a choisit le nom à cause d’un film des années 70 qui met en scène la négation de l’autorité sous toutes formes. Avec Ali, on rêvait d’un lieu qui nous ressemble. Aujourd’hui, il existe, et au quotidien, c’est plutôt Ali qui s’en occupe, moi je suis les affaires d’un peu plus loin, mais on se parle tous les jours, et j’y passe beaucoup de temps.\r\n\r\n “De toute façon, je passe ma vie dehors, dans les bars et les restaurants, je ne fais pas grand chose d’autre en fait. Dès le matin, quand je sors de chez moi, je vais prendre mon petit déjeuner dans un café. C’est mon rituel à moi. Je m’installe au café Mörder (nb : le mot signifie “assassin”), et c’est là que je croise les gens, on échange, on se donne les nouvelles. C’est un moment que j’aime beaucoup parce que cela me donne le sentiment d’appartenir à une communauté, d’avoir des liens avec tous ces gens qui m’entourent. C’est un peu comme comme avoir une vie publique… J’aime savoir ce que font les gens qui sont autour de moi, j’aime comprendre, je suis très curieux en fait… je regarde comment ils réagissent aux choses, ce qu’ils font, ce qu’ils ne font pas. Cela me permet de ne pas m’enfermer dans un quotidien un peu routinier, genre boulot, métro, dodo. »\r\n\r\n“Travailler, pour moi, c’est un moment de convivialité, j’ai la chance de pouvoir souvent choisir comment je travaille, et c’est très important pour moi cette liberté. On passe beaucoup de temps au travail, et j’adore le faire avec des gens que je connais, avec qui j’ai déjà travaillé, ou je sais comment ils fonctionnent… Cela rend les choses plus faciles.”\r\n\r\nManuel hésite, il ne sait pas très bien s’il a d’autres rituels. Au bout de quelques minutes de réflexion, il lance : “En fait, je crois que mes rituels sont assez simples. J’ai une vie totalement urbaine. Le matin, je prends mon petit déjeuner à l’extérieur. Le soir, je sors pour voir des gens, je bois et je fume. Entre les deux, je travaille.”\r\n\r\n“L’alcool joue un rôle très important dans ma manière de vivre, il est toujours présent. Cela permet de prendre certaines choses moins au sérieux, on est plus concentré sur les choses qui sont proches de nous lorsqu’on boit. C’est comme si on entrait dans un tunnel, mais on y va avec les autres… C’est la même chose que les drogues. Il m’arrive de tirer sur joint, ou de prendre de la MDMA, mais c’est rare. Il faut vraiment que l’occasion soit festive ».\r\n\r\n« Il y a des gens qui boivent beaucoup d’alcool, et tout le monde pense maitriser sa consommation, que tout va bien, que c’est cool… D’ailleurs, on dit que les alcooliques sont des gens très sociables. Je trouve que dans ces moments là, il y a des choses qui font vraiment sens, et qui le lendemain n’ont plus aucun sens. On se rend compte que le moment était bien. Mais qu’en fait il était bien moins clair que ce qu’il nous semblait… On cherche à y voir plus clair dans la vie, et en fait tout le monde s’embrouille. Le soir, quand on boit ensemble, c’est un moment de détente, on laisse des choses à l’extérieur du bar… mais tout le monde arrive quand même avec ses histoires, ses projets, ses problèmes, … c’est comme si on était tous réunis sur une même scène, alors que pendant la journée on est chacun dans nos univers ».\r\n« La nourriture, mais aussi la musique joue un grand rôle. J’ai quelques proches que je rencontre chez eux. Là, il n’y a pas de musique, pas vraiment de nourriture, même l’alcool ne joue pas de rôle dans ces cercles intimes. D’ailleurs, il n’y pas forcément de rituels dans ces rencontres… De temps en temps, c’est des conversations, de temps en temps c’est du sexe… mais même là, je trouve que je n’ai pas de rituels ».\r\n\r\n« Il y a quelques années, je partageais des appartements avec d’autres personnes, tout se mélangeait beaucoup plus simplement. Je ne connaissais pas forcément beaucoup de monde, mais on faisait de grands dîners où tous ceux qui passaient mangeaient avec nous. Cette époque est terminé, aujourd’hui, je vis seul. On vit tous de manière beaucoup plus individuel, avec des créneau où on s’ouvre aux autres. C’est de la « convivialité organisé ». Parfois, j’ai l’impression qu’il me manque quelque chose, mais je pense que c’est en rapport avec la vie que je mène. Je vis en marge, en décalé, par rapport à beaucoup de monde, mais je ne vois pas ce que je peux changer. Il m’arrive de m’isoler car j’ai besoin de ces moments pour revenir à moi, et pour soigner mes amitiés particulières »\r\n\r\nPendant notre conversation, un homme arrive à vélo. Ils se saluent, discutent un moment ensemble, il est question du dernier vernissage qui a eu lieu au Hamburger Bahnhof, un lieu d’art contemporain. L’homme repart comme il est arrivé. Manuel me dit qu’il le connaît à peine.\r\n\r\n «La manière dont on se rencontre aujourd’hui a changé. Facebook et les Smartphones ont vraiment change les choses. Quand tu n’es pas sur Facebook, tu loupes des trucs. C’est arrivé à une amie récemment. Il y avait une fête, et quelques jours plus tard, on s’est croisé… plein de gens lui on demandé ce soir là pourquoi elle n’était pas venu ? Et elle a répondu qu’elle n’était pas au courant parce que personne ne le lui a dit, personne ne lui a parlé directement. Ce ne serait jamais arrivé il y a quelques années. Aujourd’hui, les rendez-vous sont moins précis, il y a toujours la possibilité de changer d’avis au dernier moment. On s’écrit des sms, il y a les gens qui te disent qu’ils sont en retard, ils écrivent “je suis là tout de suite”… Lorsqu’on a beaucoup de choses à faire et qu’on doit s’organiser, ça ne marche pas. Mais si on travaille comme moi, en indépendant, on peut gérer ce genre de chose. Par expérience, je sais que les choses finissent toujours par marcher… Avec les nouvelles technologies, c’est beaucoup plus simple de s’échanger des infos, mais en même temps, c’est beaucoup plus compliqué d’avoir de bonnes infos. Ce qui est vraiment difficile c’est de trier les infos. Avant, on était au courant quand il y avait une soirée, aujourd’hui, il peut y avoir une dizaine de soirées le même jour… mais du coup, on est même pas sûr de retrouver les gens… et pour ça, il faut à nouveau communiquer les uns avec les autres pour se mettre d’accord à quel soirée on va. Si tu veux voir des gens en particulier, tu es obligé de communiquer directement avec eux. Tout ça a vraiment changé, et ça n’a rien à voir avec le fait que j’ai vieilli ».\r\n\r\n« Au début quand je suis arrivé à Berlin, il y a avait beaucoup d’espace libre … C’était très facile de louer des lieux pour faire des performances, des bars, d’ouvrir des galeries. Il n’y avait pas de nécessité commerciale, il suffisait de vendre quelques bières et on arrivait à payer le loyer. Tout cela, ce n’est plus possible aujourd’hui. Les rapaces de l’immobilier ont atterris sur la ville. »\r\n\r\n« Je me souviens qu’une de mes activités favorites était de me promener dans la ville, d’entrer dans les cours, d’ouvrir les portes… Cette possibilité d’espace public s’est réduite. Ce que je faisais avec mes amis en me promenant, il y a dizaines d’années, je ne le fais plus. Toutes les cours sont devenues privées. C’est fermé. Maintenant les beaux endroits sont inaccessibles. Ici où nous sommes, c’est une exception, c’est la raison pourquoi j’aime bien être là. Il reste quelques endroits encore dans le quartier de Mitte, des lieux où on peut manger, ou des galeries… Avant, on pouvait faire plus d’expériences, on pouvait expérimenter des choses… Aujourd’hui, tu n’as pas vraiment droit à l’erreur. Avant, lorsqu’il y avait des vernissages, quelquefois, cela se terminait avec une fête. Aujourd’hui, les fêtes sont sponsorisées par une marque. Avant, il y avait quelques bouteilles de bières, et c’était tout. Aujourd’hui, faut que tu choisisses entre des cocktails. Les lieux de convivialité sont liés avec la consommation, c’est difficile de faire vivre des lieux alternatifs. Ce temps où on pouvait le faire, ou on pouvait faire vivre des lieux, des galeries, des bars sans forcément faire de l’argent, n’existent quasiment plus. Et je pense que les choses vont continuer à évoluer dans ce sens. A mon avis, Berlin va devenir une ville ennuyeuse pour les jeunes créatifs. Moi, j’y ai construis mon nid, et aujourd’hui, je ne trouve plus ça très grave de m’embourgeoiser » dit-il dans un sourire « Mais s’il reste des lieux de ce genre, ils sont à la périphérie de la ville. Peut-être que je déménagerais… Pour l’instant, je préfère maintenir des pôles de résistances à ce qui se passe, de faire face au mainstream… »\r\n\r\nA l’échelle de Berlin, on voit tout ce qui se passe mal avec ce système. Beaucoup de choses sont été décidé par le marché, le type d’architecture, le genre de personnes qui viennent s’installer dans cette ville. Il y a peu de volonté politique. Peut-être, les gens qui nous dirigent pensent applique une politique, mais c’est du néo libéralisme. Ce n’est pas de la politique. Dans le néo libéralisme, l’économie a reconnu que les gens veulent s’épanouir de manière individuelle, c’est pourquoi l’ensemble de la pub s’est concentre sur la possibilité des choix. La plupart des gens utilisent leur énergie pour se décider pour quelque chose, à faire des choix de consommation. Le résultat, c’est une uniformisation des groupes, c’est très difficile de trouver des endroits, des quartiers, des restaurants, etc… où les gens se mélangent, qu’ils aient de l’argent ou non. La liberté, ce n’est pas avoir le choix de consommer. Cette tendance, je la ressens aussi dans les conversations. Tout se complique. Prenons l’exemple de l’alcool, tu avais le choix entre une bière,.. et peut-être une vodka… Aujourd’hui, faut que tu choisisses entre des tas de trucs. On boit plus de vins, et plus d’alcools forts. On dépense plus d’argent. Payer 12 euros pour un cocktail, c’était inimaginable, il y a encore 5 ou 10 ans. Et aujourd’hui tout le monde le fait. On boit plus fort, plus longtemps, on combine des tas de trucs, le même phénomène ce passe avec les drogues. Je vois plus d’alcooliques, il m’arrive même de me faire des soucis pour les gens qui m’entourent, ou pour moi, parce que je vois que je bois trop ».\r\n\r\n« Tout ça à une incidence sur les conversations : on parle de ce qu’on va boire, de ce qu’on va manger, plutôt que d’échanger sur la musique, ou sur l’art. C’est pour ça aussi que je tenais à avoir un lieu comme le Themrock, parce que le choix est limité, et du coup les gens que j’y rencontre sont bien plus intéressants, je peux parler de pleins de sujets différents, et je découvre toujours de nouvelles choses. Et tant que je peux préserver cela dans ma vie, je suis heureux ».', 291, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/01a82dc88c72aea0.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/d785d692b44eb978.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/e7946b178c86a2e5.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/6d1f757e3886a227.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/51c5133a321caf7f.jpg"}]', 1),

I''m not really interested in politics, but I''m used to seeing all the positive aspects. Elections? Ok, the part of the city will be more beautiful. Not really matter when it is done, the main thing that it is done. In recent years Moscow became even prettier. I already told you about the territory of the factory "Red October", how everything has changed for the better. Incidentally there is one of the snapshots taken from the bridge. But shortcomings in Moscow are many more. We never developed network of bicycle paths, although there is a network of hire. This is very typical for Moscow: a lot of good ideas and poor implementation. There are bike rental, but no bicycle lanes. The public transport is not very well developed. Therefore we prefer to walk on foot. And at this warm evening we had fun even in non-ideal Moscow.', 299, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/ddebfa3540acb54a.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/f438a852aa938149.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/e0441ea4cafdabe6.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/c7e5b5241ef69dee.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/0f1cf94e9c7abbce.JPG"},{"url":"\\/image\\/650d67b8b819a91d.JPG"}]', 1),

Unfortunately in Moscow it is not very developed as in the major cities of Europe. Moreover since 1982 tram network in Moscow, which then numbered 61 route, began to decline, mainly due to the fact that the city has begun to appear more and more cars and some tram lines were removed during the expansion of roads. In different years were closed about 30 routes. In recent years there has been a reverse trend - the old routes are restored, and in the plans - the construction of new routes. As written on the website of the Department of Transport in Moscow, in 2017 will be built and restored 67 kilometers of tram tracks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately most of the tramways are on the outskirts of the city and the only line in the center . While in Europe you can be on the tram tour through the historic center of the city, in Moscow, you can only get to the center and go for a walk on foot. Another drawback of the tram lines in Moscow that it is basically isolated from the road. So if there is a lot of traffic on the street the tram gets into the traffic. In addition the stops are not near to the tram tracks, on the sidewalk. So the passengers have to cross the street. Anyway the tram has special atmosphere.

L’immeuble se trouvait en plein centre de Berlin, dans une rue peu fréquentée. Arrivée au 5ème étage, je suis entrée dans les locaux de Happy Thinking People en même temps qu’un coursier. Quelques minutes plus tard, Sven Arn me tendait la main pour me saluer. \r\n“J’ai 44 ans et je vis à Berlin depuis 17 ans, mais j’ai une biographie un peu inhabituelle. Je suis suisse, mais enfant j’ai grandit entre Munich et l’Angleterre. Après avoir fait des études de théâtre, j’ai commencé à travailler dans une entreprise qui faisait des études de marché. Aujourd’hui, c’est toujours mon employeur, ou plutôt : c’est moi le patron. Je suis l’un des associés de Happy Thinking People.\r\nNotre activité principale est d’effectuer des études de marchés qualitatives. Nous travaillons pour de nombreuses marques. La dernière étude que nous avons faite portait sur les habitudes alimentaires, notamment celle de cuisiner, car en fonction des endroits dans le monde, les gens cuisinent différemment, ils ont donc des besoins et des attentes différentes. Ce projet avait une dimension socio-culturelle, ce qui n’est pas toujours le cas.”\r\n“Ma dernière expérience de convivialité, c’était hier soir. Je viens de déménager, et j’avais convié des amis français à venir manger. J’habite maintenant sur la Frankfurter Allee, c''est l’ancienne avenue de prestige du régime de la RDA. Mon nouvel appartement à une salle à manger magnifique qui donne sur un balcon, il fallait que je l''inaugure. Nous étions 8 à table, et avons bu du vin avec des glaçons, du rosé ; l’une des bouteilles était un vin français, l’autre un vin allemand. “\r\n“Ce type de dîner est quelque chose que je fais assez souvent, en général cela arrive 2 fois par mois, et au moins une fois par mois je suis invité chez quelqu’un. Il y a quelques années, je sortais beaucoup dans les clubs, mais cela m’arrive plus rarement aujourd’hui. Je n’aime pas trop quand il y a trop de monde. Il m’arrive encore de sortir dans des bars, mais je trouve que de se retrouver à la maison entre amis, c’est plus agréable. J’aime bien cuisiner, réfléchir à ce que je pourrais bien préparer.”\r\n“A part ça, je n’ai pas beaucoup d’activités. Je fais beaucoup de yoga, mais pour moi, ce n’est pas un moment de convivialité, c’est plus une activité qui me permet d’avoir un bon équilibre le reste de ma journée. La convivialité, c’est plutôt quelque chose que je vis au quotidien puisque tous les jours, je suis en contact avec des gens, je passe mon temps à parler… et il est vrai que souvent à la fin de la journée quand je rentre chez moi, je n’ai plus du tout envie de causer. Si j’étais toute la journée assis face à un ordinateur, je pense qu''une fois ma journée finie, j’aurais plus envie de communiquer, mais ce n’est pas le cas. Je crois que chacun d’entre nous a des batteries sociales, et quand elles sont épuisées, il faut du temps pour soi pour les recharger.”\r\n“Bien sûr, il y a des moments où la convivialité est pour ainsi dire obligatoire. Par exemple, le week-end dernier, mon frère s’est marié, et c’était.. disons “semi-convivial”. Il voulait que ce soit une fête cool, sans discours, sans jeux collectifs; alors il a organisé une sorte de grand barbecue. Le résultat, c’est que les gens qui ne se connaissaient pas, ne se parlaient pas vraiment. Rien n''avait été fait pour créer un contact, du coup les gens ne se mélangeaient pas. C’est peut-être ringard d’avoir des jeux, mais je suis persuadé que dans ce type de situation ça aide à apprendre à se connaître, et à se rapprocher.” \r\n“Il y a des moments que j''apprécie tout particulièrement, c''est quand je me retrouve avec ma famille. On se voit environ 5/6 fois par an, et ce sont toujours des moments très forts. A chaque fois, on ouvre une bouteille de champagne, tout le monde s''assoit autour d’une belle table, ma mère fait divinement à manger, les vins sont d’une grande qualité… c’est un moment ensoleillé de la vie. Un de ces moments qu’on essaye de recréer ensuite dans la vie quotidienne, mais sans toujours y arriver ” ajoute Sven en souriant “Cela ressemble à un rituel, mais rien n’est vraiment ritualisé. Mes parents ont toujours des caisses de champagne dans la cave, alors ça se fait comme ça… C’est peut-être suisse comme habitude, je ne sais pas. En tout cas, je ne connais personne qui fait ça en Allemagne. Dans la famille de mon ami, les choses sont beaucoup plus ritualisés - il est d''origine italo-française - les repas ont un ordre particulier, c''est très formel, il y a l''apéritif, ensuite les entrées, etc… et puis il y a toujours le fromage, c’est impossible d’y échapper au fromage ! Mais j’adore ça ! Et j''adore aussi être invité quelque part, et que le dîner ait une dramaturgie”\r\n“Je me rends compte que la musique est importante pour la plupart des gens, mais pas pour moi. Non pas que je n’aime pas ça, mais lorsque je rentre chez moi, je ne mets jamais de musique. Je suis plutôt le genre de type qui ne remarque pas que la musique s’arrête dans une soirée…”\r\n“Il m''arrive assez régulièrement de boire un verre le soir, souvent en petit comité, avec 2 ou 3 personnes. On boit une bière et on discute. L’alcool joue un rôle essentiel dans la vie sociale, d’ailleurs ceux qui ne boivent pas sont en général exclus de ces moments de convivialité. C’est d’ailleurs tellement présent que je ressens le besoin de faire une pause tous les ans après les fêtes de fin d’années. En général, je ne bois pas d’alcool ni en janvier, ni en février. C’est ma diète personnelle. \r\nAu quotidien, il y a toujours une occasion de boire, soit avec des clients, soit avec des amis, et quand on ne veut pas boire de l’alcool, il faut toujours se justifier. Cela dit, ce sont des moments de partage. Souvent on se met d’accord sur ce qu’on boit, c’est une espèce de communauté. Et puis il y a l’effet... Je ne suis pas du tout adepte du binge drinking comme cela existe en Angleterre. En Allemagne, il arrive aussi qu''on se saoule, mais ce n’est pas la priorité. Bon, c''est sûr que si on participe à l’Oktoberfest à Munich – la fête de la bière – on sait qu''on va jouer le jeu ; c’est à dire qu’on sait très bien que qu’on va finir debout sur le banc à hurler des chansons comme les autres. C’est des moments festifs, je ne bois jamais d’alcool en journée, sauf lorsque je suis dans un autre pays :  en Inde par exemple. Nous avons un bureau dans ce pays, et il est d''usage là bas qu''en fin de journée on boit whisky sur whisky avant d''aller manger. Alors que par exemple, les français continuent de boire du vin après le repas. Tandis que les allemands proposent plutôt des digestifs à la fin du repas, ou posent une soucoupe pleine de chocolats ou un truc dans ce genre… ce qui est impensable pour les français. En Allemagne, les repas ne sont pas importants culturellement, c’est quelque chose qu’on fait pour ainsi dire "à coté". La semaine dernière, j’étais à Munich, et en 4 heures de temps, j’ai bien du avaler un litre de bière ; à un moment donné quelqu’un est allé chercher des bretzel pour qu’on grignote quelque chose, mais jamais il a été question de “manger” … alors qu’en France, le repas est au centre de la soirée, et dicte ce qu’on boit. \r\n“Il y a vraiment des évolutions dans la manière de festoyer ensemble, les choses ont beaucoup évoluées ces dernières années, c''est plus souple, il y a moins de formalisme, la preuve c’est qu’aujourd’hui on ne mange plus dans la salle à manger mais dans la cuisine. Les choses se font plus simplement, on cuisine ensemble, on fait un barbecue ensemble… ou alors on en fait un moment “spécial”. Par exemple, on organise des dîners où tout le monde doit venir en blanc, ou on fait une recette d’un pays qu’on a visité…."\r\n“Berlin aussi a changé. Avant, il n’y avait rien ici, aujourd’hui à tous les coins de rues on trouve un restaurant, il y a toutes les cuisines du monde. A mon avis, les nouvelles technologies ont joué un rôle primordial dans l''abandon des formalismes. Elles permettent d''être plus spontané, on poste un message sur Facebook du genre : j’ai acheté du poisson, qui vient dîner ? Ou alors on envoie un sms aux gens qu’on a envie de croiser, ça va très vite. Du coup, certaines règles sociales réapparaissent, les gens s’envoient à nouveau des cartes postales, ou des cartes de remerciements, ou même des sms pour dire que la soirée était sympa. Il y a une sorte de nostalgie des bonnes manières qui s’est mise en place… mais elle est acceptable car ce sont des rituels ou des formalités qu’on choisit. Ce serait terrible si c’était des règles qui étaient imposées, mais c’est cool, parce qu’on peut choisir.”\r\n“Même la manière dont les soirées se passent a évolué. il n''y a pas si longtemps, on regardait des trucs sur you tube. Maintenant, chacun joue sa musique via son smartphone. Les nouvelles technologies sont omniprésentes. Hier soir par exemple, je racontais une histoire à mes amis, mais je ne me souvenais plus de la fin, j’ai donc envoyé un sms à la collègue qui me l’avait raconté pour qu’elle me rappelle la fin. Cela dit, je trouve cela terrible quand tout le monde est sur son portable. Je viens d’ailleurs de travailler sur une étude qui démontre que les gens ont tendance à s’en détacher… certains commencent même à ne plus vouloir avoir de téléphone portable. Jusqu’à là, on avait tendance à penser que ces technologies allaient nous envahir de plus en plus, mais cela s’inverse. Il ne faut jamais sous-estimer le facteur humain. C’est comme avec l’apparition de you tube, au début, c’était intéressant, et puis on s’en lasse, on y va uniquement pour quelque chose de particulier.”\r\n “Lorsque j’ai déménagé, j’ai lancé une invitation via Facebook, et c’était vraiment dur d’inviter des gens qui n’était pas sur Facebook, ça m’a prit deux semaines…je ne suis pas fan de ce réseau social mais pour la vie sociale, je trouve cela vraiment très utile."\r\n“Je suis issu de la génération "work hard, play hard". Dans les années 90, on travaillait beaucoup, mais le week-end on faisait la fête pendant 3 jours, et de manière excessive, avec de la drogue, de l''alcool… C''était comme ça à Berlin en tous cas. Il y avait pleins de gens qui n’avaient pas de job, pas d’argent non plus, alors on passait son temps à faire la fête, et c’était possible. Aujourd’hui quand je vois les jeunes générations, je me dit que ça leur ferait du bien de fêter un peu plus. Même lorsque je vais au Bergheim – le temple de la techno – les gens qui font la queue à l’entrée on souvent plutôt mon âge. D’ailleurs mes mes collègues qui ont entre 25 et 30 ans, faire la fête pour eux, c’est souvent se retrouver sur une terrasse, et boire des hugo. C’est un mélange de sirop de bouleau, de vin pétillant ou d’eau minérale, avec un peu de menthe et des glaçons… ou alors ils boivent du prosecco. Et ce n’est pas une question d’argent. Quand j’avais leur âge, je n’avais pas d’argent mais on achetait quand même du champagne, ou du bon vin… cela faisait partie de ce sentiment d’excès : acheter une bouteille de champagne alors que tu n’as pas d’argent c’était déjà énorme. Aujourd’hui j’ai l’impression que tout est mesuré : il ne faut pas trop boire, pas trop manger, pas trop voyager, pas trop ceci, pas trop cela, être en forme le samedi, etc… tout est très équilibré. Il n’y a plus cette volonté d’intensité.”\r\n', 316, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/0a1e52cf88138337.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/e4323c9d6c06aaac.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/2f117bcf8f798fd7.jpg"}]', 1),

Bien que je suis à l’heure, Peter est déjà là. Il m’attend en piétinant, il a faim, et me demande si je veux l’accompagner pour dîner. Il est à peine 18 heures, mais il est vrai que les allemands mangent tôt. Pourtant Peter n’a aucune envie de manger là où nous sommes alors qu’il est l’un des associés propriétaires du lieu.\r\n “Allons manger une pizza sur une terrasse” décrète-t-il. Peter habite Berlin depuis une quinzaine d’années, il se définit comme un gastronome, quelqu’un “qui aime boire et  manger et qui en a fait son métier, à condition que les lieux soient particuliers”. \r\nDurant toutes ces années, il a tour à tour investit des lieux qu’il a à chaque fois transformé, des bars, des restaurants, des bars-restaurants, des bistrots, des brasseries. A chaque fois, c’est une nouvelle aventure « je me fabrique ainsi mon propre monde”. Peter avoue que le monde tel qu’il est ne lui plait pas vraiment, et créer des lieux dans lesquels les gens se retrouvent, c’est une manière pour lui d’être toujours au centre des choses sans forcément avoir l’obligation d’y participer. D’ailleurs, il ne se sent pas vraiment prendre part à la société qui l’entoure.\r\n\r\n« Je ne suis engagé dans rien, je ne fais pas de bénévolat, pas de sport, je n’ai pas de vie associative. Les seules choses que je fais, c’est travailler, manger, boire et être avec mes amis, la vie quoi ! »\r\nEntretemps, nous nous sommes installés sur la terrasse d’une pizzeria un peu en retrait de la Prenzlauer Allee, c’est l’un des premiers restaurants qui s’est implanté sur cet axe urbain après la chute du mur. « Une Marguerita, une Ruccola,  une bière, un sauvignon blanc, et une grande bouteille d’eau gazeuse » ordonne-t-il au serveur venu prendre notre commande.\r\n\r\nC’est un moment convivial comme Peter sait les fabriquer. «La convivialité, après tout, c’est un peu son travail. Mais le dernier moment de convivialité que j’ai passé, c’était avec hier soir. J’ai fait à manger pour ma copine et son fils, c’était un très joli moment de partage. J’aime beaucoup ces moments où on se retrouve avec des gens qu’on aime. Il y a quelques jours, je me suis rendu au concert de Neil Young , et ce qui m’a le plus plu, c’était le fait de faire le trajet ensemble, de discuter, boire des bières, prendre le metro, reprendre un dernier verre ensuite. Quand j’était plus jeune, c’était des trucs qu’on faisait souvent, aller au concert, etc….on allait ensemble à des festivals, on faisait du camping, il y avait des trucs totalement exotiques à manger…tout ça, ce sont des trucs qu’on ne fait plus quand on est adulte. Ce truc de potes. Aujourd’hui j’appartiens au monde adulte, bien que je ne veuille pas en faire partie, à bien y réfléchir je ne me considère pas comme “adulte”. Aujourd’hui quand je me retrouve avec des gens, ce sont des vernissages, ou à des dîners, comme le week end dernier, c’était le galerie Week end. Chaque année, les galeries d’arts berlinoises organisent des portes ouvertes durant un week-end. Je me suis retrouvé à un dîner où plus de 80 personnes étaient assises autour de la table. A coté de moi, il y avait une femme qui m’a raconté qu’elle avait une aventure avec Mike Jagger dans sa jeunesse alors qu’elle était une mannequin. Ce qui était drôle, c’est que j’étais au milieu d’un groupe auquel je n’appartenais pas. D’habitude, ce type de personnes, ce sont mes clients, et là, je me retrouvais assis au milieu d’eux “.\r\n\r\nEn 2007/2008, nous avons ouvert le “Bandol”, et ça a très vite marché. Je ne pourrais pas vraiment expliquer pourquoi, il y avait un truc dans l’air… c’était le moment où les berlinois s’intéressaient à la cuisine française, même dans le quartier populaire de Neukölln, ils se sont mis à faire des croissants. Notre restaurant est devenu le point de repère dans la Tortstrasse, et par la suite d’autres sont venus s’installer. \r\n\r\nTout ça n’a rien à voir avec ce que vivait mon père ou mon grand-père. Quand j’étais petit, je faisais du tennis, j’avais des camarades, des entraineurs, etc… je faisais la même chose que tout le monde. J’ai grandit dans un village, et comme  dans tous les villages, on se crée une bande, et après on fait tout ensemble. Les gens pensaient qu’on était un gang, des méchants…mais en fait on se rencontrait juste sur la place du village, c’est vrai des fois on s’embrouillait avec d’autres jeunes. La musique jouait un rôle important, on l’écoutait ensemble. C’est un truc qui ne se fait plus, aujourd’hui chacun est branché sur son Mp3 et écoute sa musique.\r\n\r\nMalheureusement, je n’ai jamais réussi à instaurer des rituels dans ma vie comme mon grand père en avait. Dans son armoire, il y avait un ruban rouge où était accroché toutes les décorations qu’il avait obtenu dans sa vie… par exemple, la médaille des 50 ans du Chœur dans lequel il chantait. Au dessus, il y avait des photos punaisées. Mon grand père était un des militant fondateur du SPD, le parti social démocrate. A chacun de ses anniversaires, il recevait des cartes postales, elles étaient toutes punaisées à l’intérieur de la porte de son armoire, et chaque fois qu’il l’ouvrait pour choisir sa cravatte, ses yeux s’attardaient sur elles. Moi, mes rituels sont très simples. J’aime lire le journal le matin en prenant mon petit déjeuner. Si je peux pas le faire, ça me manque, et c’est à peu près tout.\r\n\r\nAujourd’hui, je me suis promené dans la ville, et je suis repassé à des endroits précis qui étaient importants pour moi. Quand on s’est senti à l’aise quelque part, on a envie de revivre le moment, alors on s’accroche à ces souvenirs.\r\n\r\nL’alcool joue un rôle important, c’est une pratique largement acceptée. Généralement, d’ailleurs quand je me retrouve avec mes amis, c’est pour boire. Et là, on peut se saouler si on veut, sans avoir à se justifier… C’est comme prendre des drogues ensemble, cela donne un sentiment de communauté… Boire ensemble rend ses amis plus sympas, je trouve. Moi, je bois principalement de la bière et du vin… surtout du vin, sauf quand je regarde le foot, ou que je vais à des concerts, là, je bois de la bière…\r\n\r\nA la maison, quand j’étais petit, il y avait du vin pour le repas du dimanche. De l’alcool fort, il y en avait quand on avait un truc à fêter, ou un anniversaire.\r\nAujourd’hui, j’ai le sentiment que les gens se saoulent très rapidement, ça va très vite. On boit bien plus vite qu’il y a 10 ans. Je m’ettone moi même parfois de la vitesse, et de la quantité qui est avalé. Lorsque j’étais plus jeune, quand on était étudiant : on buvait peut-être 3 bières dans la soirée… Aujourd’hui, la jeune génération commence sa soirée au schnapps. Lorsqu’on sort aujourd’hui, avant, il y a toujours une “schnappsrunde”. Récemment, j’ai fêté mon anniversaire, et j’ai vraiment été surprit à quelle vitesse tout disparaissait, et pourtant, je suis dans le métier, je suis sensé pouvoir estimer les quantités… et bien, je me suis trompé. Même moi, je bois beaucoup plus qu’il y a quelques années encore.\r\n\r\nMon grand père fêtait son anniversaire tous les 5 ans. Moi, je fais ça aussi. J’invite une dizaine ou une vingtaine de personnes, ça dépend…des gens que j’aime bien, avec qui c’est agréable de passer du temps… bien sûr c’est pas le moment où les conversations sont les plus intensives, mais de toutes façons, au delà de 6 personnes, on ne peut pas avoir de conversation.\r\n\r\nLes nouvelles technologies sont aussi apparues dans ma vie, \r\nJ’ai un facebook, mais je m’en occupe pas, je ne l’alimente pas. Je n’ai pas l’impression de faire partie d’un réseau, en fait…mais je me trompe certainement. Par deux fois, je me suis rendu à des évènements qui étaient annoncés via facebook, et c’était plutôt nul…Je me suis dit : plus jamais ! J’ai aussi déjà pensé aussi à effacer des gens de mon facebook parce qu’ils font sans cesse leur propre publicité. Personnellement, je n’ai pas envie de faire partie de ce monde où tout devient marchandise. Il y a des gens qui font de leur vie un évènement perpétuel, c’est devenu leur métier.\r\n\r\nPersonnellement, je ne peux pas m’imaginer que ma vie soit entièrement rythmé par cela…Le temps où on s’envoyait une lettre est révolu. Aujourd’hui, tu envoies une photo avec ta signature. Point. Avec ces technologies, on est soumis à une certaine pression. On est sans cesse observé. On est obligé de répondre, on te demande pourquoi tu n’as pas répondu, faut poster des photos spéciales du genre : salut, je suis à Copenhague. C’est une manière de rester en contact avec le monde car c’est plus difficile de rencontrer des gens au quotidien. Mais il y a des couacs aussi du coté nouvelles technologies, le téléphone via internet où on se voit en parlant par exemple n’est pas aussi utilisé que ça. Les gens n’ont tout simplement pas envie qu’on les voit en permanence, ils tiennent quand même à leur sphère privée. On n’est pas obligé de se prendre au jeu. Je connais des gens dans mon entourage qui n’ont pas de portable. » C’est à ce moment là que notre conversation se termine car Peter répond à un sms qu’il vient de recevoir. Une belle conclusion à cette conversation.\r\n', 317, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/5113c7d1dd529182.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/1eaef401aadfa01a.jpeg"}]', 1),

L’adresse m’a été indiqué par mail, et l’immeuble dans lequel je me rend est connu pour sa boite de nuit qui surplombe le dernier étage. J’entre dans un immense Loft où une dizaine de personnes s’activent, l’ambiance est créative mais concentrée. Les derniers préparatifs de la prochaine exposition sont en cours. Un jeune homme en tenue sportive se dirige vers moi pour me saluer, c’est Nicolas Zeh, il est le maître des lieux.\r\n\r\n« Je vis à Berlin depuis 12 ans. J’ai 36 ans, et je co-dirige MADE depuis 3 ans. Je suis en charge des opérations marketing et de la direction artistique. Ce qui m’intéresse dans ce lieu, c’est que souvent les gens ont des idées mais l’argent pour les réaliser manque, et moi je suis là pour relier les deux : les idées et l’argent. Je suis un intermédiaire qui comprend les besoins et les intérêts des 2 parties.\r\n\r\nMADE est un lieu de créativité qui se fait en partenariat avec Absolut. Si ce lieu s’est ouvert ici ce n’est pas par hasard, c’est un lieu stratégique dans cette ville, on est situé en plein milieu, en hauteur. Cela nous permet aussi de démontrer qu’une marque peut prendre l’Art au sérieux. Les artistes comprennent très vite qu’ici ils ont la possibilité de se réaliser, de créer ce qu’ils ont dans la tête sans se poser la question de comment ils vont le financer. »\r\n\r\n« Je passe mes journées ici, et par définition, c’est un lieu de rencontres, les gens passent, on ne manque jamais de compagnie, tous les jours,  il y a du mouvement, c’est à l’image de cette ville. Nous avons \r\ncrée une plateforme où si tu veux trouver de la créativité à Berlin, tu viens chez MADE. »\r\n\r\n« L’une de mes autres activités où je me retrouve avec les gens, c’est lorsque je pratique le yoga. J’en fais 4 fois par semaine 1h30 à chaque fois. C’est comme une petite collectivité, je ne suis pas ami avec tous, mais on partage quelque chose d’universel ensemble.  Le yoga me structure mes journées, c’est un rituel. Il y a toujours un début, et puis une fin. C’est comme un repas. \r\n\r\n« L’un des autres moments de convivialté que je partage, c’est lorsque je mange avec les gens. Ce n’est pas très important ce qu’on mange, mais plutôt le fait qu’on soit ensemble. Souvent on est à 8 ou 10. Manger ensemble, c’est faire acte de vie consciente.\r\n\r\n Je vois bien qu’autour de moi, les gens en ont assez du fast-food, assez du superficiel. Il y a une demande pour plus de profondeur, plus de chose durable, également dans les relations ». pendant qu’il parle Nicolas Zeh répond à un email, je remarque alors sur son pouce un tatouage, c’est un éclair de couleur violette. Il reprends « Le monde va trop vite. Les gens sont entrain d’en prendre conscience. Pendant longtemps, ils suivent le modèle proposé par la société, celui qui est sensé les rendre heureux. Il faut avoir une voiture, de préférence une mercedes, etc.. Et un jour, on se rend compte que pour avoir tout cela, il faut dépenser beaucoup d’énergie, tellement d’énergie que tu en tombe malade, que tu es fatigué, déprimé… Souvent il faut un choc pour comprendre qu’il faut changer quelque chose, où tu finis par attraper un ulcère. Ce qui est vraiment important, c’est par exemple de partager du temps avec ma famille, par exemple. Quand tu as un enfant, tu te réorientes vers des besoins fondamentaux. »\r\n\r\n« La musique est pour moi un support émotionnel. Mais je n’en écoute pas tous le temps, cela peut aussi me perturber. Dans une fête, par exemple, si tu passes de la mauvaise musique, tu casses l’ambiance. Par contre, lorsque tu te sens abattu, avec de la bonne musique, tu peux arriver à te motiver. »\r\n\r\n« L’alcool, je le conçoit plus comme un plaisir. Tout comme la drogue. Mais là, je vois qussi des évolutions autour de moi. Il y a de plus en plus la notion de « prise consciente ». Ceux qui vivent le moment, ceux qui mangent et boivent consciemment que ce soit une tomate, ou un verre d’alcool. Et puis il y ceux qui profitent du week-end pour se shooter à toutes les drogues. Je crois qu’on va de plus en plus vers un clivage. Deux groupes de populations aux besoins différents.»\r\n\r\n« Ici, à MADE, on crée des évènements, mais aussi des alcools, des cocktails… on a des gens qui sont spécialisé pour cela, ce sont des DJ de l’alcool. Je bois de temps en temps quand c’est le bon moment, quand j’en ai vraiment envie... »\r\n\r\n« Les nouvelles technologies sont faites pour toucher les masses, mais en réalité, c’est une agression permanente. Il y a tellement d’infos qui sont intéressantes, comment veux tu faire le tri ? Tu es toujours dans l’idée que tu es toujours entrain de rater quelque chose. Moi, j’ai appris avec mes parents de faire des jeux, à grimper aux arbres. Bien sûr, j’utilise les nouvelles technologies pour accéder à certaines informations, mais en fait, j’en donne très peu. Je regarde certains blogs. J’utilise facebook comme un filtre. Je ne twitte pas, et je n’utilise pas Instgramme. Tout ça c’est trop rapide pour moi. J’ai un filtre personnel » dit-il en désignant un jeune homme assis de l’autre coté de la table « C’est Nadaf, mon assistant, c’est lui qui me transmets les infos que je dois savoir. Là aussi, je trouve que le monde se divise en deux, ceux qui vivent à travers ces réseaux, et ceux qui ont envie de se recentrer, vers la nature, vers l’humain. Aujourd’hui, on arrive à une nouvelle étape dans la civilisation, on commence à avoir la technique, mais il s’agit d’atteindre la prochaine étape de l’évolution. »\r\n\r\n« Le monde change très vite. Il y a peu de temps encore, on était tous dans des corsets, on avait des règles. Il y a 15 ans encore, si on avait eu cette conversation, on ne se serait jamais tutoyer. Quand j’étais petit, et que j’allais à l’école, tout le monde se levait à l’entrée du professeur. Ces valeurs là se perdent aujourd’hui, mais personnellement j’aime plutôt ce genre de codes. Là aussi, je pense qu’on assiste à un retour de certaines règles de société, et il y a des gens qui vont soigner cet aspect des choses, et d’autres qui seront complètement à l’écart de ce genre de choses.\r\n\r\nNicolas Zeh se tourne vers un des collaborateurs qui l’interpelle. Il est temps pour lui de rejoindre son équipe. La prochaine exposition doit s’ouvrir dans quelques jours.\r\n\r\nhttp://made-blog.com\r\n\r\n', 318, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/01a344ee6f43987f.png"},{"url":"\\/image\\/95d4e2960e539137.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/c0ef8a45c749a88f.jpeg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/"},{"url":"\\/image\\/aaecce47f9228e54.png"}]', 1),

En parallèle je fais de la peinture et de l''illustration, que je publie et expose de temps en temps à Berlin et en Europe de l''Est (Vienne, Belgrade).\r\n\r\n- Peux-tu nous préciser depuis quand?\r\n\r\n- Je suis arrivée à Berlin pour commencer mes études en 2005, mais c''est en 2010 que j''ai montré mon travail graphique au public pour la première fois, lors d''une exposition à Berlin.\r\n\r\n- Est-ce que tu souhaites vivre de ton art, vois-tu comment y parvenir?\r\n\r\n- Pour l''instant je ne peux pas encore vivre de mon art, par contre les réseaux que je me suis créés lors de mes études m''ont permis de trouver un public intéressé par mon travail. C''est en effet chez les slavistes berlinois que j''ai mes plus fidèles clients.\r\n\r\n- Donc tu vends certains de tes tableaux et dessins, comment t''y prends-tu?\r\n\r\n- Oui, jusqu''à présent j''ai toujours réussi à vendre des tableaux lors de mes vernissages, mais rarement en dehors de ces événements. C''est à chaque fois très difficile pour moi de fixer un prix pour chacune de mes oeuvres. Pourtant lors des vernissages, j''ai l''impression que le prix importe peu et que les personnes désireuses d''acquérir une oeuvre en tiennent peu compte: c''est l''événement du vernissage qui sert de catalyseur.\r\n\r\n- Est-ce que tu organises seule tes vernissages?\r\n\r\n- Tout dépend du format de l''exposition. J''ai fait deux expositions solo à Berlin que j''ai organisées toute seule du début à la fin, une à l''Université et une au Bar Babette, sur la Karl-Marx-Allee. C''est moi qui me suis chargée de trouver un local, de gérer la logistique, de monter l''exposition, d''organiser un buffet, de faire la communication. Mais j''ai aussi participé à plusieurs expositions de groupe dont deux dans le cadre d''un festival, et là c''était le comité d''organisation du festival qui s''occupait de tout, je venais en tant qu''invitée et le stress de l''organisation ne reposait pas sur mes épaules.\r\n\r\n- Qu''as-tu à dire sur les expositions de groupe auxquelles tu as participé?\r\n\r\n- C''était d''autant plus festif que je n''avait pas la responsabilité de l''organisation, ce qui me permettait de profiter davantage de la célébration et du buffet, je me permettait davantage de boire du vin avec mes amis, de rencontrer les autres artistes, de prendre le temps de discuter avec eux. Ma participation au festival Novodoba (festival de bande dessinée et de musique expérimentale) m''a donné un sentiment fort d''appartenance à un groupe, avec ses codes et surtout ses rituels très festifs, avec des gens qui ne se prennent pas trop au sérieux. Dans ces vernissages souvent accompagnés de concerts, le lien entre le dessin et la musique est très important.\r\n\r\n- Ton impression de ton tout premier vernissage?\r\n\r\n- Ce qui m''a beaucoup marqué, c''est que comme mon premier vernissage a eu lieu à l''Université, dans les locaux du Département d''Etudes Slaves, j''avais invité tous les slavistes berlinois et les représentants du milieu de l''édition et de l''animation culturelle en rapport avec l''Europe de l''Est mais aussi tous mes amis, c''était important pour moi qu''ils participent à ce moment de ma vie. Ce mélange inhabituel était très réussi puisque tout le monde s''est retrouvé autour des tableaux et surtout du buffet.\r\n\r\n- Comment était le buffet?\r\n\r\n- Le Département d''Etudes Slaves avait mis les petits plats dans les grands, des plateaux d''amuse-gueule avaient été commandés à un restaurant russe de Berlin, un peu chic, le Pasternak, et avec ca était servi du Prosecco qui coulait à flot. Il y avait même des toast avec du caviar noir et des oeufs de saumon. C''était un moment très fort. J''ai eu le sentiment de changer de statut, passant du rang de l''étudiante anonyme à celui d''une petite célébrité locale.\r\n\r\n- Justement, qu''est-ce que ce vernissage a changé dans ton rapport avec cet environnement universitaire?\r\n\r\n- Je ne sais pas exactement ce qui a changé avec l''environnement universitaire mais mon rapport intime à mon travail ou à mon art disons à changé du jour au lendemain, ce vernissage a donné une dimension professionnelle à ce que je considérais jusque là comme un passe-temps ou une passion. Je me suis retrouvée à gagner de l''argent d''une manière extrêmement agréable. J''ai vendu cinq tableaux à mes professeurs, qui non seulement par ce geste m''ont encouragée à continuer mais encore m''ont montré qu''ils reconnaissaient cette passion comme un véritable travail. J''avais passé pas mal de temps à peindre pendant le semestre précédant l''exposition et à aucun moment les enseignants ne me l''ont reproché. Je pense que le système universitaire allemand est particulièrement favorable à ce genre d''expériences.\r\n\r\n- Qu''est-ce qui a changé dans ta sociabilité universitaire?\r\n\r\n- Après ce vernissage, ca a été la première fois que dans mon Institut on se mettait à me reconnaître, les gens se sont mis à me saluer même ceux que je ne connais pas. Parfois je croise quelqu''un qui me dit «Ah oui vous, avec les dessins!».\r\n\r\n- Comment le public est-il informé de tes vernissages? Est-ce que les moyens de communication que tu utilises ont changé depuis ta première exposition?\r\n\r\n- J''utilise le plus de canaux de diffusion possible, les mailing-lists de la slavistique, un magazine en ligne de littérature slave pour lequel je travaille et que j''ai quelque peu détourné à cette fin, la newsletter de mon blog, et les réseaux sociaux (facebook, twitter, etc.). Depuis mon vernissage pourtant, j''ai quitté facebook parce que je n''étais pas d''accord avec leur réglement et leurs conditions d''utilisation, et je remarque que du coup je peux atteindre moins de monde, mais je ne regrette pas d''avoir quitté facebook. Je continue à envoyer des mails avec l''actualité de mes productions et j''ai des retours très positifs. Certains me disent pourtant que je me tire une balle dans le pied en n''étant pas sur facebook.\r\n\r\n', 319, 'null', '[{"url":"\\/image\\/5b6fb7441c6ab15b.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/766999cc656283f6.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/c97c39b79ec48637.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/2c2d6ca04ae09ff2.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/dcd8c29a37ce8ef5.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/aa0705a22ad49548.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/84785720c71da6d7.jpg"},{"url":"\\/image\\/238993ad232c98b6.jpg"}]', 1),

This time last year I was shamefully unaware of this fact, and strangely enough it was ten minutes in Canning Town tube station which enlightened me. Traveling into the city was surreal on that crisp October morning. As I stepped off of the train to make my change for the Jubilee line I felt like I had entered a different world. The usual depressing reality of the dark dusty station was met by the color and vibrancy of the eager MCM crowd. The noise and color of the crowd created a stark contrast to the usual suit clad business men on their way into the city for work and I walked the length of the platform was met by an army of colorful characters from all times, places and realities. To my right a group of frilly Lolitas stood talking excitedly about the day ahead, Mario and Luigi were leaning against the wall drinking star-bucks and in the distance the cast of Kingdom hearts stood arguing about directions at the tube map. It was at this point that I realized how important the cos-play is to the mcm Expo. The usually heavy atmosphere of the station was now light and optimistic. The noise of the trains almost drowned out by the excited crowd on their way to the Excel. It may have just been the event itself which created this atmosphere of excitement and optimism but I couldn’t help feeling that the costumes and humor of the cos-play was also having something to do with it.', 331, 'null', '[{"url":"http:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=lAO0WNdMMgY","title":"Cosplay - London Super Comic Con - Cosplay Music Video"},{"url":"\\/image\\/007b53ac3a8da723.png"},{"url":"\\/image\\/48fdf78801d0a5a6.png"}]', 1),
