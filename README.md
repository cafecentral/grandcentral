Grand Central
=========
Grand Central is a free, open source Clearly Magical Framework, with a unique write-less-do-more syntax.
It's content agnostic, so you can develop a social network of humans, a blog of reviews or a bike shop.
It's API-centered, so you can power a website, a mobile app or json services.
It's pretty, so you want to use it.
It's social, so the content you're managing intertwines with the persons you're managing it with.
It's user-abstract and event-based, so human can use it, but it also runs machine-to-machine businesses: you can let your phone communicate with your 3D printer.
We are currently under development, but having as many eyeballs on the code helps us keeping it hi-quality.
